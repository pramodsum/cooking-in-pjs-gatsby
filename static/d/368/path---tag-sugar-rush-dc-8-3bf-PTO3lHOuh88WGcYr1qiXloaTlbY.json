I\ncame home craving cookies, which is pretty rare - while I like dessert, I've\nnever especially been a cookie person. In most cases, if there's an option\nbetween a cookie or almost any other dessert, I would choose the other dessert.\n\n\n\nBut that day, I came home wanting a cookie. I wanted something sweet but not too\nsweet, with a bit of a bite at the end. A cookie with a mysterious past, or a\nteasing glint in its eye. Something dark and chocolatey - the type of cookie you\ncan only eat one of.\n\n\n\nI wanted the kind of cookie that overwhelms you and seduces you at the same\ntime. I wanted the Rhett Butler of cookies, and this is what I got.\n\nI'd say it's pretty close.\n\nSpicy Chocolate Cookies\nThese cookies are fool-proof. I thought the batter was too dry, and that I had\ncooked them too long, but neither of these things were true. Also, they're so\ndark, no one will be able to tell if you burn them a little bit. This is not a\ncookie to fear, but one to embrace, with a tall glass of milk (almond or\notherwise) on the side. There are a few different version of this cookie, and as\nfar as I can tell, they are all extremely similar (read: delicious); feel free\nto experiment and see what works for you!\n\nYield: 12 2-inch cookies, 24 1-inch cookies/p>\n \n\nTotal Time:  Approx. 1 hour\n\nIngredients:\n\nCookies\n1 2/3 C Flour\n 1/2 C Unsweetened Cacao Powder1/2 Tsp. Cayenne Powder1/2 Tsp. Cinnamon Powder1\nTsp. Baking Soda1/4 Tsp. Salt1/2 C Canola Oil1/4 C Maple Syrup1/2 C Granulated\nSugar3 Tbsp. Milk\n Topping\n1/4 C Granulated Sugar\n 2 Tsp. Cinnamon\n Directions:\n\nStart by mixing all of your dry ingredients together, until all the spices and\ncacao are fully incorporated.\n\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Combine your sugar, oil, maple syrup, and\nmilk, and whisk lightly until incorporated. Make a well in the dry spices and\npour the wet ingredients in, mixing until incorporated. The dough should be\ndense and have a texture reminiscent of wet sand.\n\nMix the cinnamon and sugar for the topping. Form the dough into flat disks and\npress the top of each into the sugar before placing on a lightly oiled baking\ntin. Let bake for 30 - 40 minutes. Allow to cool completely prior to eating.\n\n    </p>\n  </div> \n</div>","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/klU5ii_yhduVXILSrGppqt714g1XSRSRnF30MCGT-oGblTAqhcdzVoPoX6tTkW0J0l7Tb_y5YMJApIm2OGEK8tbMU_XNEVhc7cW5QvYnReH_rcid8iKduKSC5LgkS4R2s0Hal9O4Pl2kF-z3eosW5penH176HMm1j0Boxrp1EHMCeaUFAJDm_LSJybLhap6Nx51yfJxi5aG2S319wTEgEg-s_FKg0J0uzkINewzfoQnRlqlq4K3ZkyYRMaBmX7lcccZSvRVzVMavHTMjXWTZL50FBXqpyuarofy5rLxrD4pNvmKBmzox-mmIqTVkcojIwCuX7MlKbvPGQgDFdfcmgbzoi4wnYNc65_qds7HtWtSYihPqH_zOwG95zWEwtY4SMc8cAXIvxuWf5QKqrV-KM9-0CsdkUVwf4Z6fqBVOGG5QxIfHPzCNq_AE9Y4NfBwIJqhii5ECG-LRP0MgcLS5ti4l0GRm4CNTecS8Nlreyw4ARdox2MSKW6GkaZYdQ7OQLJHTglAq2GawyZJ7t3rv5Xz3od5gqmbHLQ0U5sxqwZwzBAK84EHktCG04ZdKPC_a2grk=w362-h643-no","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2a8","name":"sugar rush","slug":"sugar-rush"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"sugar-rush","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
