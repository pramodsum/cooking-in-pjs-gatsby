First off, there's no turkey. Secondly, <a href=\"http://uppukhara.com\">my mom</a> makes a glorious display of Thanksgiving inspired Indian dishes! From masala dosa with cranberry chutney to stuffing upma (or bread upit) and spicy herb yams, we always enjoy a large variety of dishes. The only thing I personally demand every year is pumpkin pie! I love pumpkin pie. The wonderful blend of spices and sweet, and yet it's not that sweet; perfect for someone without a strong sweet tooth!</p>\n<p>What do you get when you combine two of my favorite desserts in the world, pumpkin pie and tiramisu? Basically, it's one of the greatest desserts ever created by man. I was a little skeptical about how well this combination of flavors would be received by all of our thanksgiving guests, but it was a hit. Even without adding the usual brandy, rum, or amaretto, everyone loved the wonderful blend of flavors.</p>\n<p>One warning I have about this recipe is that you should be careful in blending the cornstarch mixture into the pumpkin creme. If this step is not done properly, you will have cornstarch lumps in your tiramisu and that is just gross.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7450/16296261980_1c317311c8_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7575/15837079972_56f32edc3e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7532/15650090328_71473d0b07_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Pumpkin Tiramisu</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Recipe modified from  http://www.nytimes.com/projects/well/vegetarian-recipes/#recipe/pumpkin-tiramisu</em></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n        <h4>Pumpkin Creme</h4>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">⅓ cup cornstarch</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ cup water</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ cup milk</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ cup maple syrup</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ teaspoon allspice</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ teaspoon cinnamon</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ teaspoon nutmeg</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">½ teaspoon salt</li>\n        <h4>Tiramisu</h4>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 pot black coffee</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 package lady finger biscuits</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">16oz mascarpone cheese</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">ground chocolate for garnishing</li>\n      </div>\n    <!-- </div> -->\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p><strong>To make the Pumpkin Creme:</strong> In a small bowl, thoroughly mix cornstarch and water with a whisk or fork until there are <strong>NO  LUMPS</strong> and set aside. In a medium saucepan, whisk together milk, pumpkin puree, maple syrup, spices and salt, and heat over medium heat until it just begins to boil, about 5 minutes. Slowly drizzle cornstarch mixture into the saucepan, whisking continuously. Cook until the mixture becomes very thick, about 5 minutes, whisking frequently. Pour the creme into a bowl and let cool about 15 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap so that the plastic wrap is touching the top of the creme. Refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.</p><p><strong>To assemble:</strong> Soak each lady finger biscuit in coffee for a few seconds and quickly place in a large dish. Spread a layer of Pumpkin Creme on top. Repeat this process for as many layers fill up the dish or all the components run out. Alternate spreading a layer of Pumpkin Creme and mascarpone cheese between layers of biscuit.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8632/16297442359_be80bb9139_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"The Love Child of Pumpkin Pie and Tiramisu","slug":"the-love-child-of-pumpkin-pie-and-tiramisu","published_at":"27 February, 2015","feature_image":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7398/16297798177_79beaa8237_o.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c238","slug":"tiramisu"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c240","slug":"pumpkin"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c241","slug":"thanksgiving"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c24b","slug":"pumpkin-pie"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","slug":"desserts"}]},"next":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8645/16430694707_4453e07de4_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Whenever I'm home, my mom sometimes sautés some vegetables and keeps them for me to use with whatever I make for lunch. Usually that ends up being some simple pasta, vegetable fajitas, or toppings on a veggie burger. This time, I figured, why not try something different and make a veggie patty using these vegetables!</p>\n<p>It ended up being some kind of frittata/omelets/burger patty thing. While I may not be entirely sure what to call it, it tasted wonderful. And to my delight, it photographed really well! I actually ate the patty by itself but you could definitely eat these inside a burger or chopped up in a salad. So many options!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8577/16636556891_1f78750ce7_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8670/16018075843_3491552743_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <span class=\"item\">\n      <h2 class=\"fn\">Quinoa Veggie Patty</h2>\n    </span>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Recipe inspired by  http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/epic-crispy-quinoa-burgers-topped-sweet-potato-fries-beer-caramelized-onions-gruyere/</em></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup cooked red quinoa</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup chopped mushroom</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup sliced zucchini</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup sliced squash</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup sliced red onion</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 handful baby spinach</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp red pepper flakes or dash of cayenne</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">salt and pepper to taste</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">lime slices for garnishing</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">chopped green onion for garnishing</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        Mix all ingredients together and roll into medium-sized balls.
