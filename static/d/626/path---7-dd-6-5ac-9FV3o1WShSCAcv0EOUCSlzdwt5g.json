For example, I (Anu) spent half the year in India, but you guys never read about my adventures with street food, or my quest to find the best masala dosas in Bangalore. While Sumu kept you all a bit more updated on her goings on, the fact is, we both want to do better.</p>\n<p>So with that in mind, we're challenging ourselves to post once a week each in 2016! You'll be getting a new post from Sumu on Wednesdays, and Anu on Sundays. We'll be sharing bits of our lives and kitchens all year, and in the interest of accountability, we've decided to implement some penalties for failure to deliver.</p>\n<p>Offense 1: Donate ten dollars to a slush fund that we will donate to a charity at the end of the year! Every other penalty on the list is also accompanied by this, so there's potential for us to donate 80 at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Offense 2: The innocent party gets to pick 1 song for you to listen to during your entire commute.</p>\n<p>Offense 3: The innocent party gets to take a picture or pictures with puppies and send it to the offender, to show them what they're missing.</p>\n<p>Offense 4: The Chopped Challenge; the innocent party assigned the offending party a random list of ingredients, from which they must produce and consume a meal. The production of said meal must be videotaped for the innocent party's viewing pleasure.</p>\n<p>Any offenses over and above this will result in the offending party having to complete a dare that is entirely up to the whim of the innocent party. So that's pretty terrifying. All posts will also include the tag #challenge2016 so you can also check up on us.</p>\n<p><strong>May the force be with you</strong></p>\n<p>We hope you're as excited as we are :)<br>\nSumu and Anu</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VZbmOFixe3qVzvC-U7QLvsJcUQeV79GACQl0DPf4gIEKj5oFw27pplxZG6e1UwB7s_FujTfxfHLTyyyLxZlceDET3cC5gD0aItG1FYd_Dl3d1Vo5KWKx5cOJMcvvEjvbNx3-CHg90QmtpBpwjaJvZ7qX6L16KXL1j-nl1JUOuP_HbuqTTLdH0v2FoABqTx6Cmlp5DIvvzZ5YJwxsdmBX9a3uA2mhKdPDd_7covcnCiXsSMakXWaDPFBl5_J2B8joh-lgKgRfACEZrQSLTpPeULuOT5cJuEmxqw-MPQNb50K3P7M5vHgqL1o34_uVf9m5FLevjSWsaz-Ykx_FXq20bTABd10Q7X4P0Bal0NIYMYQ3vaK3Xdi1qcrGtrLhd6C4Yag0d-aq2iqEIj6T39RtlKWMG9jfJWGDpnqGmTn4QDPf3oP-2It0WMFM8TcGvlKOPF41SIHmTpSGmt0Lvc4vpqYHYJ8IuH5KDyJmi87gycu2hiMeqG9Lb1eX971UPP4hXwDfcAyWK2s1mWmmCPsglA4SHXtUntmi7xsfPsIfbxt4VEpf-FrzqtjqlWQaSzrC1Ceu_g=w353-h546-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>NOTE: I (Sumu) have done a complete redesign of the blog so please email me @ <a href=\"mailto:sumu@cookinginpjs.com\">sumu@cookinginpjs.com</a> if you've got any thoughts/bugs/general comments about it so I can address them ASAP!

A lot of people attended and learned a lot about what Box is doing to improve the gender disparity in tech. Sadly, we overestimated how much granola we needed and ended up with 2 GIANT bowls of granola left over.</p>\n<p>In my head, it seemed like I could bake those into some variety of oatmeal cookies and breakfast bars and be done with it. No matter how much granola I used, it seemed like it was never going to end! Thankfully after making 3-4 batches of these oatmeal bars I finished 1 bowl, but I ended up making some dark chocolate fruit and nut clusters as well (post coming soon).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sGP7DG-ogISOqpn5cRBPGfuyssXcg4RgvQrrHS9UhVFMELUH4_UZmo210YRzTkLpdPGWv5x2ZFM4jExGZQWfocYpQGZdZiHKQEKg_pqMyhN-So95F9-dypl_FJpWELhBfs86l7Rrk3qWGPTpStQ2mG0CXPGYFOdcO6eQmaDVSSRKcHBhyWGXjPdALsaiblUo92stdgRYxOSGCk7Mti2VVkQekoIIf1z_qxwYD63gjXrQUKzap7dodLYFyONtcohBmOK4iEFcCs5Y3Wtl9J9J8dw6uZzJ1qLmDI_OT7Pt_vGAgDYXeQC-C_jAD4BBiIS4jJUAr-Auuh75uxjDm6RsGFl211_fuQ91zKMO-DMCW_i3H6tQHGCUpGDbuFNID-Tf5BZDIAiCIom05iwRRAt9I5CU6tx_e_Ppjj7dBAiKOLOCQA96jWOUdFkqw5ClRrZ7xvmdX9OR_Odhx-04FI6_Ugi9BPUFpx24NvgIuaOiQc6efIcEYOwsOWtycdKE1xhIjAo613H3h9zv3EUO09L8M1DSPgixNHUwMZwr6aOdOl1r=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In all honesty, these cookie bars were SO much better than those chocolate clusters (as scrumptious as those look). The crumbly-ness and chocolatey-ness of these bars complemented each other perfectly. I've actually saved all the extra crumbles to top ice scream sundaes. Think about how delicious that would be!!! Now that you're officially drooling thinking about that, here's the recipe.</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie Bars</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">3 cups granola (or oats)</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup butter, melted</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 cups chocolate chips</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 cups flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1½ cups brown sugar</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp baking soda</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1½ tbsp vanilla</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 eggs</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray.</p>\n        <p>Add everything but the chocolate chips into a bowl and mix until just combined. I don't have a standing mixer or this would have been much easier and less messier. Stir in the chocolate chips.</p>\n        <p>Spread the batter into the baking dish. Bake for 25 minutes or until a tester comes out with just a few moist crumbs. Bars should look slightly underdone. Let cool 1 hour before cutting into bars. (But let's be honest here... I couldn't wait more than 10 minutes)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Because the granola I used wasn't very sweet it didn't overly sweeten the bars either, which was something I preferred. Similarly, using brown sugar instead of normal granular sugar kept the bars less sweet. Make sure not to overcook the bars or they won't be as gloriously crumbly!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uQrAyDivSMbcmNtvHNBFu_QdSkQPcf2sZgjnRyK68wk8V9SYj8q2L4Zjl6gG2qsOnHao_a5nTKX9qm7T76p6eGY5ZaLABI6SBgCxTsdh3grdS_IvVj2xMRqvp7A5oX8ZksEX80b_6stHwWjiPs-kz014FANeFRWv8x8icGwd0wJ5w7s_hWQnEAEwUiEEX91_Uxb0SxlNsXJTbhlCoCqh_HyxKUJRmoR5LQ9LcTF87CSBz2rFfQHLlgZC1qk61bVwoSy_YnlFKVR5Izcx3yPmu2vp0zx183nfiNmZdKbJ60mc8Jm_jlmk1Z-KtqmdAVSxaFZ6sqtPOsggjwXEZIH0hFHZOPhgX6zfyzH_vLQ0tWPQa1OUAmMOWp_zm3-3umJ1tGTifgjs0RlrqxiuTWfjfSr8POYttNJSh7m1DzHRT5prbidF1SQIYAMJfzUIKJlA7nprMc_VraNXjf3ZRFTbirubqyuNvj3CQAU4OTHchOAfTg0JLIrqD82Od4P5RNHn8UvUSACLgNkiWC6H4NIhZPsyiS-dqiNk2xSa7HROpk_K=w1440-h1080-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mUbMEZZQ3oGBxeqw6y0s1Ee_WGOWWcNnZ3zeRT0ExYBdCKJNgdcj3PNwxOxBf8Pt1eBEcr-bRArg7ZtA-hrAh3IEfd1avJxPewZ2QooCl9ibPMd4zcTEmQVjd0FDpLWCwqhZdtCCC0mmMk3AD7UF8n_WINUEybW63C8CE0ttVFJzdD4edmr4H-3BapJLd2kRdfG5ifRodUO5KkZsLcQtcGUbTYIDJWzs3J4Ijb-G5Ax80OQdgHLlhjUSpGJ9uQNJ_-JkpgypKRGE5OpK3_OFAqYOq_AYQvaEkz9WmOUeLjI_n4kXlJGUjiu5-rybvT7Oswc8iSxqedjskMlFZFfCmL1A_K3ZRx7foBC8s1gdnigzUJU48Dw7lPCjp9-7Gz3VaBeq6bdzQL-HurwFbxwUF16k5yxvZ_h1tett6jpaiADX5frvd9ZTK8TdSqWdGsnbT8zNLLSBPRYYeuOZWxp45HL-kZrYaqcvBBaa900-A4BQFzmUzP6KO8PsfOlieW3lzVG_fUrXacU4JlYCdLBa7q2_YSoh_GMFX5HEwCX23nSo=w1440-h1080-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2lPmzUu82FpK-bF10uC-AJpZ8xIWniOm2cCYIRfno-lDDrHJp5zBVeNAPCaaBZMwDVZ_wv9-tiO4OVMUyv90BGrb3cpDcawOhIjnkkM5FtDsXUzWoa9hfnflZZ7wgFq13L44Si8-D4RHJ17O8KP8aKIOKPDpYr_MbISDtZtCZh9enMUhh-1esqJO16NL8-suXV6hO6JlMnyzjQwFNeww9sUlZuwprBxko5kC1YvUsa1Vk69b02093F_4JuCdlWORn_SJA97gLJzvlnDVI3HIZYQ41o0e2JJA0SEdMgv9PRki8xj4fJtI_E2W_DdiYKPg3AulAqqO0Qx9i9q9pMjUZEiNmjzAFa_BcAWYSPRb27EM8s8BujPmrAWM8AxNpE2mjd0OJRddfyJlkVXZyu0j6PJizFjtEP43x6uSPcgL5SrNdACc4g8EVrth-qPHxy2eOnhYgEtc-wR80827fG_pKrzy8nwUfVmIEMbtOHRf1zD06ZNVPjqADJ8CSbxv5vOAP-DZNKtUnK4AViSQA8OpchyEQRquO5A8NeFuN9qKZLez=w1440-h1080-no","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c28b","name":"chocolate","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29e","name":"oatmeal","slug":"oatmeal"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29f","name":"granola","slug":"granola"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c368","uuid":"f874d388-7289-41a8-bdc1-129c0d14f429","title":"Gettin' your morning BUZZ","slug":"gettin-your-morning-buzz","published_at":"17 July, 2015","html":"<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gquRgPeHK7UIko5umk1TUzm8W2f1cqgDWrLEcVfmC8K1=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>To be completely honest... this song isn't quite perfect for this post but it was the first one that came to mind for this post.

I was just as disappointed as you are right now.

Anytime anyone sees their local Girl Scouts at the grocery store, they start drooling and daydreaming of Thin Mints, Tagalongs, Samoa's, and Do-si-Dos. Girl Scout cookies are some of my favorite type of cookies in the world. While I may mainly be a fan of the plain shortbread cookies, Trefoils. Thin mints and Samoa's are America's two favorites.</p>\n<p>While plunging into the depths of Pinterest one day, I found a recipe for mini samoa donuts. That got me thinking... What if I were to make mini girl scout themed cupcakes. And to make them even better, give them a slight &quot;adult&quot; twist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LVZHqaB-oL-fVWQXFOi2BHG5JYGj8Y-hcensdE9O9mSA=w1312-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Not to toot my own horn, but these donut bites were <em>AMAZING</em>. Although they were <em>really</em> donuts... but rather cupcakes. They still tasted great. There was definitely not enough alcohol in any of the desserts to do any damage but the slight bourbon taste in the caramel brought out some awesome flavors.</p>\n<p>My cousins and I even had a hard time not finishing up the caramel bourbon sauce before the donuts were ready. We kept eating spoon by spoon of the creamy booze-ness.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Drizzle some warm caramel bourbon sauce onto a scoop of ice cream... HEAVEN.</p>\n<p>When I took these desserts to work, they were gone within minutes. Clearly everyone else was dying to get their Girl Scout cookie fix like I was. I even saw this guy spooning caramel bourbon sauce into his coffee to make it a little more &quot;Irish.&quot; ;)</p>\n<p>Here are the recipes for the donut bites. Even if you don't make the bites themselves... you DEFINITELY have to try the Caramel Bourbon sauce. It takes a few minutes to make and is EXTREMELY rewarding.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BYvxNbTPOJb518dtM6jLTZ9gwTDpQpmuj15u6oPPormA=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pk7bQdao45MiJPXztLw3P1jt6yLFAw5g-mIGogM4G2O5=w1458-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Samoa Donut Bites</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <h4>Donuts:</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ tsp baking powder</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ cup milk</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ tbsp lemon juice</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp butter, melted</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">4 tbsp Southern Comfort Caramel</li>\n      <h4>Caramel Bourbon Sauce</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 package melting caramel (about 14 oz)</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">3 tbsp milk</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp Souther Comfort Caramel</li>\n<pre><code>  &lt;h4&gt;Toppings&lt;/h4&gt;\n  &lt;li class=&quot;ingredient&quot;&gt;3 cups unsweetened coconut flakes, toasted&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;h3 id=&quot;directions&quot;&gt;Directions:&lt;/h3&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

I had gotten closer last time but not enough.</p>\n<p>What basically followed was me obsessively watching videos on how to make the perfect macarons.

And I figured if I made them all blue and yellow then all the better... GO BLUE! I looked at the recipe, saw the ingredients and was confident that this dessert was within my range of baking abilities. In fact, I was SO confident that I called a friend of mine to come over and reap the benefits of my baking!</p>\n<p>Clearly such confidence could only yield brilliant results.</p>\n<p><strong>WRONG</strong></p>\n<p>Making macarons is a very delicate process that requires a lot more patience and skill than I had ever anticipated! And for that very reason, the adorable macarons I had been picturing in my head came out like this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JjfOtdZpKGPUnJWQXW5VSqnS-09Xoi1kbel7l62Q72S2=w1756-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Exactly like you picture macarons in French Patisseries right?! I know... I was just as disappointed as you. It basically became some strange almond flavored fruit roll ups. Not at all appetizing. Now there was another problem... I had a <strong>TON</strong> of almond batter that clearly wasn't going to make macarons and no idea what to do with it. My cousin saved my ass and suggested I just convert them into almond cupcakes.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I think it was my disappointment at failing to make macrons but I half heartedly made these cupcakes. So much so that I didn't even bother with my usual photo shoot of the final masterpiece. I have absolutely no photos of what they turned out to look like. Nada. Zilch. But imagine they looked something like this except light yellow and blue with little almond specs all inside.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.afarmgirlsdabbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/530_IMG_7507_white-cupcakes.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>They weren't especially sweet cupcakes so I figured they needed some kind of topping to balance out the flavors. I went back and made some of my handy caramel bourbon sauce, which is just melted caramel, a little water, and some <a href=\"http://www.southerncomfort.com/age?ref=caramel\">Caramel Southern Comfort</a>. First off, it's heavenly and just a little boozy. Secondly, it basically takes you 2 minutes to make.</p>\n<p>Finally having somewhat salvaged this disaster, I took the box of what I thought was my failures to work. After keeping it out in the lounge area, I quickly learned that the combination of almond cupcakes with caramel bourbon sauce works.... like <strong>really</strong> works.</p>\n<p>Anyways, here's what I think was the makeshift cupcake recipe.
