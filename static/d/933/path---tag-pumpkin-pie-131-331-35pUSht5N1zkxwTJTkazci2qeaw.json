To be honest,\nI thought it was an all-American thing (immigrant probs, amirite?) So I\nresearched - and I found out that historically, sweet potato pie was a food\nslaves made in the south. And I had no idea until I made it and someone else\ncalled me out on it!\n\n\n\nHere's the thing about cultural appropriation in food - it happens ALL THE TIME.\nPeople love to take foods from other cultures - frequently every day,\ncommonplace foods - and remake them with slight tweaks and giant price tags. So\nhow do you avoid it? I personally advocate for research.\n\nI think it's important to know where the food you're making comes from,\nespecially when you're modifying it. I tend to modify a lot of recipes to make\nthem vegetarian or vegan, but I try to do it in a way that feels as respectful\nto me as possible.\n\nI think there's space in food for innovation, but it has to be accompanied by\nrespect for the important place that food has in culture.\n\nSo, the moral of this story? Don't appropriate. Don't glorify the food of\nanother culture without trying to understand that culture itself. Accept that\nyou'll probably be clueless even with additional information, and do your best\nto be respectful.\n\nAnd also, have some pie.\n\n\n\nSweet Potato Pie\nThis is a filling dessert. You could tell yourself it's healthy because it has a\nvegetable as a filling, but let's be real - this is not a healthy dessert. And\nthat's a good thing - sometimes dessert just needs to be decadent.\n\nYield: 1 Pie\n\nTotal Time:  2 hours active cooking time\n\nIngredients:\nPie Crust\n3 C Flour\n 1 Tsp Salt3/4 C Coconut OilIce water, as needed\n Sweet Potato Filling\nThree Medium Sweet Potatoes\n 1 C Coconut Milk Liquid or 1/2 C Almond ButterMaple Syrup, to taste1 1/2 Tsp\nCinnamon1/2 Tsp Cardamom1/2 Tsp Pumpkin Pie Spice1 Tsp Vanilla Extract1 Tsp\nOrange Extract\n Directions:\n\n1.) The pie crust recipe is the same dough as that of my [Love\nTriangles](http://cookinginpjs.com/love_triangles/) from last week. The first\ntime I did it, I added a little bit too much ice water - perhaps a couple\ntablespoons too much - and I wound up with a loose dough I didn't want to add\nmore flour to. So that time, I rolled it out hastily, trying not to handle it\ntoo much to avoid the coconut oil melting prior to baking. This time I managed\nto avoid that pitfall, and carefully added only as much water as was necessary,\nresulting in a soft, elastic, and close-to-perfect dough. I recommend prepping\nand chilling that before you do anything else.\n\n\n2.) I went the simple route; I chopped the sweet potato small, into pieces about\na half inch wide. After you do that, douse them in spices and throw them in the\noven until they are melt-in-your-mouth cooked. Or, you know, about thirty\nminutes.\n\n\n3.) Mashed them, add maple syrup, the some almond butter, or the liquid from a\ncan of coconut milk for creaminess, and your spices and extracts. You want to\nmake sure it isn't too sweet, tasting every time you add a new ingredient to -\nahem - \"assess quality.\" Make sure that the pie isn't so sweet that you can't\ntaste the sweet potato. The goal is to enhance it so it can be the star, not\nmask it.\n\n\n4.) Preheat the oven to 375 F. Take out your pie dough which has, of course,\nchilled for at least four hours at this point, and roll it out gently. Set it\ninto a pie pan/tin, and crimp the edges however you're like. Reserve the cut off\nbits to create a decoration for your pie. Pop the crust in the oven for about\nfifteen minutes.\n\n\n5.) After the pie crust has baked for about fifteen, take the pie out of the\noven and layer in your filling. You want it to be up until the rim of the pie\npan - this filling won't expand, so you can fill it right up. Put the pie back\nin the oven for about twenty minutes.\n\n\n6.) In the meantime, roll out your spare dough and get creative! I went the way\nof stars and diamonds because those are the cookie cutters I found, but the\nworld is your oyster. When twenty minutes have passed, take your pie out of the\noven and carefully place the decorations on top. Put it back in for another 20\nminutes. Proceed to turn on the oven light and watch excitedly, as I did (I\nthink I mistook it for a television).\n\n\n7.) After another twenty minutes have passed, increase the oven temperature to\n400 F, and place your pies on the top rack - I like my top crust to be a little\nbrown, and this makes that happen!\n\n\n8.) Take your pie out of the oven and serve it up! I loved it with a dollop of\ncoconut whipped cream, but it would likely also taste good with ice cream, or\nnormal whipped cream, or any manner of things. It was also excellent all on its\nown.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/1me34o8e4hrj5zs0hqullpkoduharuvp.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","name":"sugarrush","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c3","name":"sweetpotato","slug":"sweetpotato"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c24b","name":"pumpkin pie","slug":"pumpkin-pie"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bc","name":"pastry","slug":"pastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c4","name":"piecrust","slug":"piecrust"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","name":"vegan","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c5","name":"vegetarian","slug":"vegetarian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c370","uuid":"d9ce1d74-5a37-463a-8cb8-d33efe58626f","title":"The Love Child of Pumpkin Pie and Tiramisu","slug":"the-love-child-of-pumpkin-pie-and-tiramisu","published_at":"27 February, 2015","plaintext":"\n\nThanksgiving in our house is quite different that the traditional American\nThanksgiving. First off, there's no turkey. Secondly, my mom\n[http://uppukhara.com]  makes a glorious display of Thanksgiving inspired Indian\ndishes! From masala dosa with cranberry chutney to stuffing upma (or bread upit)\nand spicy herb yams, we always enjoy a large variety of dishes. The only thing I\npersonally demand every year is pumpkin pie! I love pumpkin pie. The wonderful\nblend of spices and sweet, and yet it's not that sweet; perfect for someone\nwithout a strong sweet tooth!\n\nWhat do you get when you combine two of my favorite desserts in the world,\npumpkin pie and tiramisu? Basically, it's one of the greatest desserts ever\ncreated by man. I was a little skeptical about how well this combination of\nflavors would be received by all of our thanksgiving guests, but it was a hit.\nEven without adding the usual brandy, rum, or amaretto, everyone loved the\nwonderful blend of flavors.\n\nOne warning I have about this recipe is that you should be careful in blending\nthe cornstarch mixture into the pumpkin creme. If this step is not done\nproperly, you will have cornstarch lumps in your tiramisu and that is just\ngross.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPumpkin Tiramisu\nRecipe modified from\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/projects/well/vegetarian-recipes/#recipe/pumpkin-tiramisu\n\nIngredients:\nPumpkin Creme\n⅓ cup cornstarch\n ¼ cup water\n ¾ cup milk\n 1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin puree\n ¾ cup maple syrup\n ¾ teaspoon allspice\n ¾ teaspoon cinnamon\n ¾ teaspoon nutmeg\n ½ teaspoon salt\n Tiramisu\n1 pot black coffee\n 1 package lady finger biscuits\n 16oz mascarpone cheese\n ground chocolate for garnishing\n Directions:\nTo make the Pumpkin Creme:  In a small bowl, thoroughly mix cornstarch and water\nwith a whisk or fork until there are NO LUMPS  and set aside. In a medium\nsaucepan, whisk together milk, pumpkin puree, maple syrup, spices and salt, and\nheat over medium heat until it just begins to boil, about 5 minutes. Slowly\ndrizzle cornstarch mixture into the saucepan, whisking continuously. Cook until\nthe mixture becomes very thick, about 5 minutes, whisking frequently. Pour the\ncreme into a bowl and let cool about 15 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic\nwrap so that the plastic wrap is touching the top of the creme. Refrigerate for\na few hours or overnight.\n\nTo assemble:  Soak each lady finger biscuit in coffee for a few seconds and\nquickly place in a large dish. Spread a layer of Pumpkin Creme on top. Repeat\nthis process for as many layers fill up the dish or all the components run out.\nAlternate spreading a layer of Pumpkin Creme and mascarpone cheese between\nlayers of biscuit.","feature_image":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7398/16297798177_79beaa8237_o.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c238","name":"tiramisu","slug":"tiramisu"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c240","name":"pumpkin","slug":"pumpkin"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c241","name":"thanksgiving","slug":"thanksgiving"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c24b","name":"pumpkin pie","slug":"pumpkin-pie"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pumpkin-pie","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
