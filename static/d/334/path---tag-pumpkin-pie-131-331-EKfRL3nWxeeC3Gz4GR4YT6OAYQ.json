To be honest, I thought it was an all-American thing (immigrant probs, amirite?) So I researched - and I found out that historically, sweet potato pie was a food slaves made in the south. And I had no idea until I made it and someone else called me out on it!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/iw7ilzj11mwwevcfd9rwv4255nyunmla.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Here's the thing about cultural appropriation in food - it happens ALL THE TIME. People love to take foods from other cultures - frequently every day, commonplace foods - and remake them with slight tweaks and giant price tags. So how do you avoid it? I personally advocate for research.</p>\n<p>I think it's important to know where the food you're making comes from, especially when you're modifying it. I tend to modify a lot of recipes to make them vegetarian or vegan, but I try to do it in a way that feels as respectful to me as possible.</p>\n<p>I think there's space in food for innovation, but it has to be accompanied by respect for the important place that food has in culture.</p>\n<p>So, the moral of this story? Don't appropriate. Don't glorify the food of another culture without trying to understand that culture itself. Accept that you'll probably be clueless even with additional information, and do your best to be respectful.</p>\n<p>And also, have some pie.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/b9pw4yztlvyi87dno5qfnd1tryy08fyw.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Sweet Potato Pie</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>This is a filling dessert.

The pie crust recipe is the same dough as that of my  [Love Triangles](http://cookinginpjs.com/love_triangles/) from last week. The first time I did it, I added a little bit too much ice water - perhaps a couple tablespoons too much - and I wound up with a loose dough I didn't want to add more flour to. So that time, I rolled it out hastily, trying not to handle it too much to avoid the coconut oil melting prior to baking. This time I managed to avoid that pitfall, and carefully added only as much water as was necessary, resulting in a soft, elastic, and close-to-perfect dough. I recommend prepping and chilling that before you do anything else.  \n</p><p>\n2.) I went the simple route; I chopped the sweet potato small, into pieces about a half inch wide. After you do that, douse them in spices and throw them in the oven until they are melt-in-your-mouth cooked. Or, you know, about thirty minutes.\n</p><p>\n3.) Mashed them, add maple syrup, the some almond butter, or the liquid from a can of coconut milk for creaminess, and your spices and extracts. You want to make sure it isn't too sweet, tasting every time you add a new ingredient to - ahem - \"assess quality.\" Make sure that the pie isn't so sweet that you can't taste the sweet potato. The goal is to enhance it so it can be the star, not mask it. \n</p><p>\n4.) Preheat the oven to 375 F. Take out your pie dough which has, of course, chilled for at least four hours at this point, and roll it out gently. Set it into a pie pan/tin, and crimp the edges however you're like. Reserve the cut off bits to create a decoration for your pie. Pop the crust in the oven for about fifteen minutes. \n</p><p>\n5.) After the pie crust has baked for about fifteen, take the pie out of the oven and layer in your filling. You want it to be up until the rim of the pie pan - this filling won't expand, so you can fill it right up. Put the pie back in the oven for about twenty minutes. \n</p><p>\n6.) In the meantime, roll out your spare dough and get creative! I went the way of stars and diamonds because those are the cookie cutters I found, but the world is your oyster. When twenty minutes have passed, take your pie out of the oven and carefully place the decorations on top. Put it back in for another 20 minutes. Proceed to turn on the oven light and watch excitedly, as I did (I think I mistook it for a television).\n</p><p>\n7.) After another twenty minutes have passed, increase the oven temperature to 400 F, and place your pies on the top rack - I like my top crust to be a little brown, and this makes that happen!\n</p><p>\n8.) Take your pie out of the oven and serve it up! I loved it with a dollop of coconut whipped cream, but it would likely also taste good with ice cream, or normal whipped cream, or any manner of things. It was also excellent all on its own. \n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/1me34o8e4hrj5zs0hqullpkoduharuvp.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","name":"sugarrush","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c3","name":"sweetpotato","slug":"sweetpotato"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c24b","name":"pumpkin pie","slug":"pumpkin-pie"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bc","name":"pastry","slug":"pastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c4","name":"piecrust","slug":"piecrust"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","name":"vegan","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c5","name":"vegetarian","slug":"vegetarian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c370","uuid":"d9ce1d74-5a37-463a-8cb8-d33efe58626f","title":"The Love Child of Pumpkin Pie and Tiramisu","url":"https://cookinginpjs.herokuapp.com/the-love-child-of-pumpkin-pie-and-tiramisu/","published_at":"27 February, 2015","html":"<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7398/16297798177_79beaa8237_o.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Thanksgiving in our house is quite different that the traditional American Thanksgiving. First off, there's no turkey. Secondly, <a href=\"http://uppukhara.com\">my mom</a> makes a glorious display of Thanksgiving inspired Indian dishes! From masala dosa with cranberry chutney to stuffing upma (or bread upit) and spicy herb yams, we always enjoy a large variety of dishes. The only thing I personally demand every year is pumpkin pie! I love pumpkin pie. The wonderful blend of spices and sweet, and yet it's not that sweet; perfect for someone without a strong sweet tooth!</p>\n<p>What do you get when you combine two of my favorite desserts in the world, pumpkin pie and tiramisu? Basically, it's one of the greatest desserts ever created by man. I was a little skeptical about how well this combination of flavors would be received by all of our thanksgiving guests, but it was a hit. Even without adding the usual brandy, rum, or amaretto, everyone loved the wonderful blend of flavors.</p>\n<p>One warning I have about this recipe is that you should be careful in blending the cornstarch mixture into the pumpkin creme. If this step is not done properly, you will have cornstarch lumps in your tiramisu and that is just gross.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7450/16296261980_1c317311c8_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7575/15837079972_56f32edc3e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7532/15650090328_71473d0b07_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Pumpkin Tiramisu</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Recipe modified from  http://www.nytimes.com/projects/well/vegetarian-recipes/#recipe/pumpkin-tiramisu</em></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n        <h4>Pumpkin Creme</h4>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">â…“ cup cornstarch</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">Â¼ cup water</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">Â¾ cup milk</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">Â¾ cup maple syrup</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">Â¾ teaspoon allspice</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">Â¾ teaspoon cinnamon</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">Â¾ teaspoon nutmeg</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">Â½ teaspoon salt</li>\n        <h4>Tiramisu</h4>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 pot black coffee</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 package lady finger biscuits</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">16oz mascarpone cheese</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">ground chocolate for garnishing</li>\n      </div>\n    <!-- </div> -->\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p><strong>To make the Pumpkin Creme:</strong> In a small bowl, thoroughly mix cornstarch and water with a whisk or fork until there are <strong>NO  LUMPS</strong> and set aside. In a medium saucepan, whisk together milk, pumpkin puree, maple syrup, spices and salt, and heat over medium heat until it just begins to boil, about 5 minutes. Slowly drizzle cornstarch mixture into the saucepan, whisking continuously. Cook until the mixture becomes very thick, about 5 minutes, whisking frequently.

Refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.</p><p><strong>To assemble:</strong> Soak each lady finger biscuit in coffee for a few seconds and quickly place in a large dish. Spread a layer of Pumpkin Creme on top. Repeat this process for as many layers fill up the dish or all the components run out.
