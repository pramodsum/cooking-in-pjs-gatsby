Anytime anyone sees their local Girl Scouts at the grocery store, they start drooling and daydreaming of Thin Mints, Tagalongs, Samoa's, and Do-si-Dos. Girl Scout cookies are some of my favorite type of cookies in the world. While I may mainly be a fan of the plain shortbread cookies, Trefoils. Thin mints and Samoa's are America's two favorites.</p>\n<p>While plunging into the depths of Pinterest one day, I found a recipe for mini samoa donuts. That got me thinking... What if I were to make mini girl scout themed cupcakes. And to make them even better, give them a slight &quot;adult&quot; twist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LVZHqaB-oL-fVWQXFOi2BHG5JYGj8Y-hcensdE9O9mSA=w1312-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Not to toot my own horn, but these donut bites were <em>AMAZING</em>. Although they were <em>really</em> donuts... but rather cupcakes. They still tasted great. There was definitely not enough alcohol in any of the desserts to do any damage but the slight bourbon taste in the caramel brought out some awesome flavors.</p>\n<p>My cousins and I even had a hard time not finishing up the caramel bourbon sauce before the donuts were ready. We kept eating spoon by spoon of the creamy booze-ness.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Drizzle some warm caramel bourbon sauce onto a scoop of ice cream... HEAVEN.</p>\n<p>When I took these desserts to work, they were gone within minutes. Clearly everyone else was dying to get their Girl Scout cookie fix like I was. I even saw this guy spooning caramel bourbon sauce into his coffee to make it a little more &quot;Irish.&quot; ;)</p>\n<p>Here are the recipes for the donut bites. Even if you don't make the bites themselves... you DEFINITELY have to try the Caramel Bourbon sauce. It takes a few minutes to make and is EXTREMELY rewarding.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BYvxNbTPOJb518dtM6jLTZ9gwTDpQpmuj15u6oPPormA=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pk7bQdao45MiJPXztLw3P1jt6yLFAw5g-mIGogM4G2O5=w1458-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Samoa Donut Bites</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <h4>Donuts:</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ tsp baking powder</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ cup milk</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ tbsp lemon juice</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp butter, melted</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">4 tbsp Southern Comfort Caramel</li>\n      <h4>Caramel Bourbon Sauce</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 package melting caramel (about 14 oz)</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">3 tbsp milk</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp Souther Comfort Caramel</li>\n<pre><code>  &lt;h4&gt;Toppings&lt;/h4&gt;\n  &lt;li class=&quot;ingredient&quot;&gt;3 cups unsweetened coconut flakes, toasted&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;h3 id=&quot;directions&quot;&gt;Directions:&lt;/h3&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
