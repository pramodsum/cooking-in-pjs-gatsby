Today is one of those days.\n\n\n\nFor the days of exhaust.\nFor the days of woe.\nFor the days of rain\nAnd those few in a row.The magical potion,\nWhich may many amaze,\nSimple preparation,\nPowerful result.\n\nA hint of ginger,\nA drop of milk,\nA spoonful of sugar,\nAnd sore throat no more.\n\nWhat magical mystical wonder is this?\nOh? You didn't you hear?\nJust some simple and plain and regular tea!\n\nSide note: this may have been inspired by one too many cups of ginger chai. I\nmay have a problem.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/klx34yb47zgi0836hqn9ujbzzxxmsc8s.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2a2","name":"chai","slug":"chai"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c0","name":"drinks","slug":"drinks"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c1","name":"tea","slug":"tea"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c2","name":"ginger","slug":"ginger"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"tea","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
