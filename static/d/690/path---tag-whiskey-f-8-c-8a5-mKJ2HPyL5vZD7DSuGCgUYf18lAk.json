This year\nwith all the ruckus that ever entertaining Donald Trump has caused, it only felt\nright to have her birthday be \"Make Anerica Great Again.\" PSA: Please do your\nresearch before this election season :)\n\nAlso... I HAD to include the video for this song because 1) Katrina Kaif looks\ngorgeous and 2) it's so damn catchy that it's become my new obsession.\n\nFor this birthday cake, I thought it'd be fun to embody one of a classic drink\nin the form of a cake.\n\nAn Old Fashioned Cake\n\n\nNot to toot my own horn, but I think this cake may have been the greatest one\nI've made so far. To be fair... I didn't make the actual cake from scratch. I\nhad initially and then had a few friends taste it because I was unsure. That\nbatch was probably the worst cakes I have ever made in my entire life.... There\nwas absolutely no way I could bring that to my friend's birthday celebration. At\nthat point, I was running short on time so I bought some standard Duncan Hines\nchocolate cake mixes and made 2 small round cakes according to package\ninstructions.\n\nHere's where the fun and experimentation started!\n\nAn old fashioned is a fairly simple drink according to Esquire Magazine\n[http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/recipes/a3880/old-fashioned-drink-recipe/]\n:\n1 Sugar Cube\n3 dashes of Angostura Bitters\n1 L Club Soda\n2 oz. Rye Whiskey\n\nSome people tend to garnish their drinks with orange peels and cherries to add\nsome flair to their drink. The hard core Don Drapers will stick to their stiff\ndrinks... but this is a cake so I had some fun with it.\n\nI decided there would be 3 components to this cake outside the base chocolate\ncake layers and the frosting on top.\n\n\n\nWhiskey Soaked Cherries\nThis is the easiest part of the entire cake. Just stick a bunch of cherries in a\njar and fill it with the whiskey/bourbon/etc of your choice. I used Jack Daniels\nfor everything in this cake because that's what we had at home. By the time\nyou're done with the rest of the cake, these cherries will be nice and boozy to\nstick on garnish the top!\n\nCandied Orange Peels\nThis part I wasn't really creative on. I followed the instructions in this\nrecipe\n[http://bakingthegoods.com/2013/12/06/drinking-buddies-recipe-whiskey-chocolate-cake-whisky-buttercream-frosting/]\n! It's actually fairly painless and you can do it while you're doing the rest of\nthe cake prep and ganache prep.\n\nNutella Whiskey Ganache Filling\nMy ganache filling ended up being a hodge podge of a few recipes I've both made\nbefore and found on the internets.\n\nNutella Whiskey Ganache\nIngredients:\n1 1/2 cup nutella\n 1 can sweetened condensed milk\n Whiskey to taste\n Confectioners sugar to thicken if needed\n Directions:\nCombine the ingredients on the stove on low heat until well mixed. Feel free to\nadd as much whiskey as you want based on how boozy you want the ganache to be.\nAllow the ganache to cool. If the ganache is still too thin, add some\nconfectioner's sugar until it thickens.\n\nAssembling this cake was pretty easy. Place a layer of cake on the plate and\npoke holes in it with the back of a wooden spoon. Pour ganache over until the\nholes are filled and a layer of ganache exists over the cake. Stack the other\nlayer of cake on top and also poke holes in this layer. Pour just enough ganache\nover this layer to fill the holes. Cover the cake with your favorite\nvanilla/plain frosting. I prefer Duncan Hines Cream Cheese frosting but that's\nup to you what kind of frosting you want! Top the cake with some whiskey\ncherries, candied orange peels, and even some chocolate or orange peel shavings\nif you want.\n\nEnjoy!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/qnuzhxf19zdc4qe7tz9qhjelervhkxc4.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c28b","name":"chocolate","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c8","name":"whiskey","slug":"whiskey"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c242","name":"giggle juice","slug":"giggle-juice"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c9","name":"birthday","slug":"birthday"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c337","name":"anerica","slug":"anerica"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c338","name":"old fashioned","slug":"old-fashioned"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c339","name":"orange","slug":"orange"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c33a","name":"cherry","slug":"cherry"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c36a","uuid":"a5004992-c2ed-4f4b-beac-59baa322db49","title":"Everyone needs a 'Lil Dicky' in their life","slug":"everyone-needs-a-lil-dicky-in-their-life","published_at":"19 July, 2016","plaintext":"So recently it was one of my closest friend's, whom we lovingly call Lil Dicky,\nbirthdays.

I've realized that I am a\nBIG BIG fan of chocolate whiskey cakes. The coffee and whiskey that you add in\ntend to cut the sweetness of the coffee perfectly and only leaves a slight\nwhiskey flavoring. It works perfectly!

I know. The title and the song I'm telling you to listen while reading\nthis post don't match, but I felt I needed to up my Drake game a bit. Plus, now\nevery time I think of Drake, I picture him doing his little \"dance\"\n[https://youtu.be/uxpDa-c-4Mc]  over and over again. It brings me a LOT  of joy.\nI also love the SNL parody of it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjeORm4LMDk] \nbut that's not really relevant.\n\nFirst off, HAPPY NATIONAL CHOCOLATE CAKE DAY! I was not aware that this was an \nACTUAL  holiday but I'm not gonna complain. I firmly believe that everyday\nshould be National Chocolate Cake Day! But hey, I'll take one day a year.\n\nSecond, it's your lucky week! You get TWO whole posts from me! I've been sick\nsince Sunday, so I've been vegetating on my couch, watching a few too many chick\nflicks, all whilst drinking the world's supply of ginger chai (hence my\ncaffeine-fueled poem on Sunday which you should also totally read and\nappreciate) [http://cookinginpjs.com/an-ode-to-chai/].\n\nSo, let's get to it!\n\nAs the self-designated baker for my friend group, I've been baking birthday\ncakes for pretty much everyone. I've been trying to tailor each cake to\nsomething either they've specifically requested or what I think they would\nenjoy. This cake in particular was for one of my friends who loves whiskey. Her\nonly requirement was that, and I quote, \"I do not kill her.\" I took it as a\nchallenge in that I was going to put as much alcohol as possible in the cake\nwhile retaining its ability to taste good.\n\nThree things happened with this:\n\n 1. I made a deliciously boozy cake\n 2. I finished a LOT of the whiskey bottle I bought for this very specific\n    purpose.\n 3. I ended up getting fairly tipsy after a few batter taste tests\n\nI also feel like I should include a warning: raw batter means raw eggs which\nalso means the potential for salmonella. So be careful not to eat spoonfuls of\nyour cake batter! That could get you very sick. Enjoy responsibly ;)\n\nHonestly, I'd say it was a completely successful experience. I totally recommend\nmaking boozy desserts to everyone (of legal age of course). :P Just don't expect\nto be productive after you put the cake in the oven. I had absolutely no\nattention span once I set that cake to bake. I ended up making one GIANT cake\nfor my friend, another little one for the rest of us to enjoy on our own, and a\nfew cupcakes for my coworkers to enjoy. I kid you not, I was swarmed and the\ncupcakes were gone within 20 minutes of me sending an email announcing the\narrival of whiskey cupcakes. I'm now officially known as the dessert lady at\nwork.\n\n\n\nChocolate Whiskey Cake\nFeel free to increase/decrease the amount of whiskey according to your\ntaste/tolerance. Just make sure to adjust the flour accordingly so your cake\nbatter isn't too liquidy. The general rule is for each extra tablespoon of\nWhiskey that you add, add an extra 2 tablespoons of flour to compensate.\n\nIngredients:\n2 1/2 cups flour\n 3/4 cups dark cocoa powder\n 2 cups granulated sugar\n 2 tsp baking soda\n 1 tsp baking powder\n 1 tsp salt\n 2 large eggs\n 1/2 cup strong black coffee (chilled)\n 1 cup whiskey\n 1 cup buttermilk\n 1/2 cup vegetable oil\n Directions:\nIf your coffee isn't chilled, then make sure to put it in your freezer to speed\nup that process. Otherwise the eggs will cook when you add the coffee to it. Set\nyour oven to preheat at 350 degrees.\n\nWhisk the eggs, whiskey, buttermilk, and oil together in one bowl. Once the\ncoffee is chilled, whisk that in as well.\n\nIn a separate bowl, stir the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder,\nand salt together. Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with all the\ndry ingredients. Make sure to keep stirring while you pour.\n\nWhisk until smooth. Taste to make sure the whiskey level is right. If not add\nmore whiskey/flour accordingly.\n\nSpray your cake pan (or place cupcake liners in your cupcake pan if you're\nmaking cupcakes) and pour in the batter. Set your timer for about 25-30 minutes\n(or 18-21 minutes for cupcakes) and wait! Poke the cake with a fork or toothpick\n(something that can reach fairly deep inside the cake). If it comes out clean,\nyou're done! Cool the cake in the pan for 15 minutes, frost and devour!\n\nI did get lazy when it came to the frosting and just bought some chocolate\nfrosting from the store. I felt it might be a little TOO much if I spiked that\ntoo, so I just spread shit tons of frosting on top of the cake/cupcakes and ate\nit. I'd say that was the better choice! If you're going easy on the whiskey\ninside the cake itself (or in the words of my friend, \"are being a little\nbitch\"), then maybe you can spike the frosting. Otherwise you've got enough\nalcohol in there to get the deed done.\n\nYes. You know you needed all these gifs right now. Don't lie to yourself. I'm\npretty sure I just stared at this gif collection for a good 5 minutes, at least.\nYou're welcome.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zh4hcqy50kwhftm3na4bh6oy0944s31z.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c242","name":"giggle juice","slug":"giggle-juice"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c28b","name":"chocolate","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c281","name":"cake","slug":"cake"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c8","name":"whiskey","slug":"whiskey"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c9","name":"birthday","slug":"birthday"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"whiskey","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
