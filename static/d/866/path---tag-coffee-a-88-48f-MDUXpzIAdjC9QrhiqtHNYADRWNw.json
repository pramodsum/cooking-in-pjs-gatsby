Can't say she's entirely fond of that nickname, but that's 1/2 the point of nicknames anyways. In that spirit, here's some Lil' Dicky for you to listen to while reading this post.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:6AoYWCzsDls6c61Zp5qTuU\" width=\"auto\" max-width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>This may be one of my favorite cakes I've made so far. I've realized that I am a BIG BIG fan of chocolate whiskey cakes. The coffee and whiskey that you add in tend to cut the sweetness of the coffee perfectly and only leaves a slight whiskey flavoring. It works perfectly! After scouring the internet and Pinterest for recipes, and making myself extremely hungry in the process, I landed on <a href=\"http://omgchocolatedesserts.com/chocolate-poke-cake/\">this glorious monstrosity</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/8fbmycxw2uol5t42d6x90my1kda2ojf2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/xur9t1vvnh7t6dxh5uf3itniel7s9ljq.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I based my recipe of that cake but made a bunch of modifications to make it more &quot;adult-friendly.&quot; Enjoy because we sure did!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/iedn3bzrza6m8jp0ni4cicl01ko1h27s.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Chocolate Whiskey Poke Cake</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n        <h4>Chocolate Cake</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 3/4 cups flour</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 cups sugar</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">3/4 unsweetened cocoa powder</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/2 tsp baking soda</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 tsp salt</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 eggs</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup brewed coffee</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup Jack Daniel's Whiskey</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup milk</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n        <h4>Chocolate Filling</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tbsp sugar</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup heavy cream</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Whiskey to taste</li>\n        <h4>Chocolate Whipped Cream Topping</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cups heavy whipping cream</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup cocoa</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

I was deprived of social interaction to such a point that I legit LOL'd at a Buzzfeed article of ridiculous snapchats for a good 20 minutes. And by LOL'd I mean curled over laughing so hard I could barely breathe. No Buzzfeed article is THAT funny. I had such bad sinus pain that working on my computer for long periods of time was pretty rough. So I decided rather than wallowing in my bed, I was going to make SOME productive use of my time... baking for you guys!</p>\n<p>I found this recipe on Pinterest a while back of <a href=\"http://www.carlsbadcravings.com/cream-cheese-stuffed-chocolate-chip-banana-coffee-cake-recipe/\">Cream Cheese Filled Chocolate Chip Banana Coffee Cake</a>. I do want to preface my recipe with this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I didn't some of the ingredients so this is my altered version for lazy bakers :)</li>\n<li>I also don't have a bundt cake pan, so mine didn't come out as gorgeous looking as this but there is one thing I CAN guarantee, which is that they came out DELICIOUS. Probably one of my favorite desserts I've ever made, next to Tiramisu and my mom's Mush Cake.</li>\n<li>I didn't have brown sugar and didn't want to bother making a second grocery store trip for that so I just didn't bother making the streusel topping that was in the original recipe. I can only imagine how much more mind blowing it would have been had I added the streusel, maybe you can make yours with it and let me know!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/1tjouximy6nxjmeaomjqkrsd4i5ouqxi.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Over the last few weeks I've been trying to figure out where in my new apartment I can do my food photography to optimize the natural light coming from my windows. In my old apartment it was extremely easy, I had giant sliding doors which brought in ALL the light and shown over pretty much my entire living room; and if that wasn't enough then I could go out onto my balcony and take the photos there! It was perfect. This week I discovered that if I angle one of my side tables properly and place the dish inside it, the light reflects off the walls of the table perfectly onto the the food and really brings out all the details in the food! I HAD FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT! Although this weird positioning did lead to some old people back pain for me because of the weird positions that I laid in on the floor to get these photos. Such is the pain for beauty.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/l2l9lmho8q088kczuewl9ll8ec4uz2b8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I mean just look at it...</p>\n<p>This is one recipe I would HIGHLY recommend you try, whether it be my interpretation or the original recipe itself.

Measure out 1/2 cup of batter and keep aside for the cheesecake filling. Stir in the chocolate chips into the remaining batter and keep aside. Measure out about 1 cup of the batter with chocolate chips and keep aside to layer on top of the cheesecake filling. Pour the remaining batter into your pan.</p>\n        <p>In a separate bowl, mix together the 1/2 cup batter you set aside earlier with the rest of the cheesecake filling ingredients on high speed until smooth and creamy.</p>\n        <p>Spread the cheesecake filling on top of the current layer batter in the pan. It's okay if it sinks in a bit, this cake is much more moist than the original recipe so the cheesecake layer is more variable in size. Pour the top layer of batter on top of the cheesecake filling.

I didn't spike these coffee cupcakes with cocaine.</p>\n<p>So, I'm not sure how many of you know this but coffee cake doesn't <em>ACTUALLY</em> have any coffee in it... I KNOW! I was just as disappointed as you are right now. Despite these cakes being a COMPLETE and utter lie, I love them down to the very last crumb.</p>\n<p>Deceit aside, this recipe was actually quite easy to make and also involved me having to make extra crumble topping to replace the amount I ate. I'd recommend doing the same for yourself :P hehe</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hvA6pTqEQm6XcEGxJR1QDpcf775kBo6WBVQX8RZ8ZJlF=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>NOTE: My crumble topping came out kind of clumpy but I think that was mainly because I got lazy and didn't add the ingredients one by one as described in the recipe. Instead, I decided to add everything at the same time and mix it.
