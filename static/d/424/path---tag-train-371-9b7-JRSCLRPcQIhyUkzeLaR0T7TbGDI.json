One of my favorite bands, Train, partnered with a California\nwinery to make a line of wines named after some of their most famous songs! What\ncould be better than that!\n\nThis was a great wine for me and my friends, especially because we all have\ndifferent preferences when it comes to wine. I prefer a really deep spicy red,\nwhereas most of my friends like drier whites or dessert wines. Surprisingly,\nthis wine solved most of our dilemmas. Each glass is smooth, sweet and spicy,\nbut doesn't lean too far in either direction. It has something for all shades of\nwine lovers! (Plus it doesn't hurt that it's under $10) It's a college wine\nlover's dream! :)\n\n\n\nDrops of Jupiter is not even the only type of wine that the Save Me San\nFrancisco Wine Co makes. They also make Calling All Angels, California 37,\nBulletproof Picasso, Hella Fine, and Soul Sister.\n\nJust pour yourself a glass, blast Drops of Jupiter\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xf-Lesrkuc], and take a trip back to the 90's!","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8782/17033305629_16faa89701_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c242","name":"giggle juice","slug":"giggle-juice"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c247","name":"wine","slug":"wine"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c248","name":"drops of jupiter","slug":"drops-of-jupiter"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c249","name":"train","slug":"train"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c24a","name":"red wine","slug":"red-wine"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"train","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
