Once I tasted it, I knew that\nI had been missing out on something delicious my entire life. Pho is a simple\nvietnamese noodle soup. Traditionally, it is made with beef or chicken with some\nmeat broth, which gives it its rich flavor. However we found a vegetarian way of\nmimicking the flavor! There's a great recipe here\n[http://ohmyveggies.com/30-minute-vegetarian-pho/]  that also had some great\nflavors.\n\nPho works best if you have fresh bean sprouts, jalapenos, and basil. When you\ndrop these into your soup, it brings out the most amazing flavors. I also\nchopped some onions, cilantro and some green onions for a little something\nextra.\n\n\n\nThe first step in the process is preparing the stock. My mom and I made a\nvegetable stock using celery, carrots, and onions among other things. All you\nneed to do is simmer vegetables and herbs in a pot and after 30-40 minutes it\nshould be done! You can also use store bought stock, as that is likely far less\nlabor intensive! If you don't mind chicken or beef broth, feel free to use one\nof those instead and add some cooked shredded chicken or beef too.\n\nNext, you want to prepare your noodles - you can buy premade rice noodles, or\nget dry noodles and cook them yourself. But be careful; if they come pre-cooked\nand packaged they may be extremely fragile and broken. This is what happened to\nme, as you can see from my pictures. Ideally, the noodles shouldn't break the\nminute you pick them up with your chopsticks.\n\n\n\nNow all that's left for you to do is to pour yourself a bowl of hot broth, toss\nsome noodles, vegetables and garnishes and top it off with some sauces.\nPersonally, I just use a little hoisin sauce and chili garlic sauce but feel\nfree to add soy sauce, sriracha, basically anything you want! The best part\nabout Pho is that it can be easily modified to suit each individual's taste!\n\nIf you haven't already, drop everything you're doing, go to the nearest\nVietnamese restaurant and dive into a HUGE bowl of Pho!","feature_image":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5615/15837085352_70e3c9fa9c_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c235","name":"vietnamese","slug":"vietnamese"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c236","name":"pho","slug":"pho"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pho","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
