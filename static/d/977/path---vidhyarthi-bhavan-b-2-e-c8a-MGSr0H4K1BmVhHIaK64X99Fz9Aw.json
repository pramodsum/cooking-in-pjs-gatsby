I always loved visiting my family there, and going for eight months was one of the most valuable times in my life. I loved every minute of it.</p>\n<p>This is a post about a breakfast place in Bangalore, Karnataka, India that everyone goes to. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/2xh4t94tv5kvay59fg04rz4uoczsmdsi.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Every city has this restaurant. It's not classically pretty, and there's no one waiting at the door to see whether or not you want to come in. This is a place where you have to leave your diet at the door (no one has any idea how many calories/protein grams/vats of butter are in your food anyway). The waiters are inattentive enough that a newcomer would have left on the spot, and there are literally never enough seats. There are a few places like this in Bangalore (in a city this big, with this much traffic, you need multiple choice breakfast spots), but Vidhyarthi Bhavan is arguably one of the most delicious.</p>\n<p>It's packed to the brim every day; I went on a Monday morning, and we had to stand behind people to snake their seats. And after we ate, people were standing behind us to snake ours. The restaurant is famous for it's Masala Dosa, although there are a couple of other items on the menu if you're interested.</p>\n<p>While you wait for your order, there are gorgeous photos of Mount Kailash, and really interesting pencil sketches of famous poets and writers of India adorning the walls.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/7opvixkr40x5e2k575lrbpy8rqnqnf1f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There's plenty of fodder for people watching, if the smells wafting from the kitchen aren't enough to keep you totally occupied. Finally, your order comes out.</p>\n<p>The dosas come to you on plates piled high in the waiter's arms (you have a brief moment where you are concerned that the bottom of someone else's plate has been all over your food); the waiter never actually looks at you before he heads to the next table. Then a second waiter, arguably less attentive than the first, comes over with a tureen of coconut, cilantro, and mint chutney and pours it onto your plate.</p>\n<p>You dig in with your fingers, barely resisting the urge to just dig in with your whole face. Finishing one of these babies is a task and a half, but you are definitely up to the challenge; going, going...gone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/by56r0iw8pjezazv9tvz46spa9zyx530.jpg\" alt=\"yummy yummy masale dosa!\"></p>\n<p>Finally, you get a cup of some excellent filter coffee to finish you right off, before you stumble into the daylight, and onto a street lined with flower and fruit merchants.</p>\n<p>You amble along, sniffing deeply and enjoying the almost-too-full-but-not-quite feeling in your stomach, and all feels right with the world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/7orlyigfozthf1tuoxjuo4cmt4etxsxh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c245","name":"india","slug":"india"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ca","name":"masala dosa","slug":"masala-dosa"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","name":"eating out","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cb","name":"indian food","slug":"indian-food"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cc","name":"south indian","slug":"south-indian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cd","name":"bangalore","slug":"bangalore"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ce","name":"vidhyarthi bhavan","slug":"vidhyarthi-bhavan"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cf","name":"nostalgia","slug":"nostalgia"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d0","name":"homesick","slug":"homesick"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"vidhyarthi-bhavan","previous":{"html":"<p>I know.

I was not aware that this was an <em>ACTUAL</em> holiday but I'm not gonna complain. I firmly believe that everyday should be National Chocolate Cake Day! But hey, I'll take one day a year.</p>\n<p>Second, it's your lucky week! You get TWO whole posts from me! I've been sick since Sunday, so I've been vegetating on my couch, watching a few too many chick flicks, all whilst drinking the world's supply of ginger chai <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/an-ode-to-chai/\">(hence my caffeine-fueled poem on Sunday which you should also totally read and appreciate)</a>.</p>\n<p>So, let's get to it!</p>\n<p>As the self-designated baker for my friend group, I've been baking birthday cakes for pretty much everyone. I've been trying to tailor each cake to something either they've specifically requested or what I think they would enjoy. This cake in particular was for one of my friends who loves whiskey. Her only requirement was that, and I quote, &quot;I do not kill her.&quot; I took it as a challenge in that I was going to put as much alcohol as possible in the cake while retaining its ability to taste good.</p>\n<p>Three things happened with this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I made a deliciously boozy cake</li>\n<li>I finished a LOT of the whiskey bottle I bought for this very specific purpose.</li>\n<li>I ended up getting fairly tipsy after a few batter taste tests</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>I also feel like I should include a warning: raw batter means raw eggs which also means the potential for salmonella. So be careful not to eat spoonfuls of your cake batter! That could get you very sick. Enjoy responsibly ;)</em></p>\n<p>Honestly, I'd say it was a completely successful experience. I totally recommend making boozy desserts to everyone (of legal age of course). :P Just don't expect to be productive after you put the cake in the oven. I had absolutely no attention span once I set that cake to bake. I ended up making one GIANT cake for my friend, another little one for the rest of us to enjoy on our own, and a few cupcakes for my coworkers to enjoy. I kid you not, I was swarmed and the cupcakes were gone within 20 minutes of me sending an email announcing the arrival of whiskey cupcakes. I'm now officially known as the dessert lady at work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zh4hcqy50kwhftm3na4bh6oy0944s31z.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Chocolate Whiskey Cake</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to increase/decrease the amount of whiskey according to your taste/tolerance.

I felt it might be a little TOO much if I spiked that too, so I just spread shit tons of frosting on top of the cake/cupcakes and ate it. I'd say that was the better choice! If you're going easy on the whiskey inside the cake itself (or in the words of my friend, &quot;are being a little bitch&quot;), then maybe you can spike the frosting.

While growing up my mom always used to sing this song to me. The song literally translates to &quot;I'm going to build a house in front of your house.&quot; It's supposed to be this cute love song where the guy wants to &quot;build his world in front of her house.&quot; My question is, wouldn't it be more romantic if he built a house FOR them WITH her? Why does he only want to be in front of her house? I may be missing some context from the rest of the movie but regardless that's a whole different tangent.</p>\n<p>This song was pretty much just my mom telling me she wants to live right across the street from my and constantly spoil her future grandchildren. I'm pretty sure my mom wanted a full on re-enactment of &quot;Everybody loves Raymond.&quot; But hey, who's gonna complain about a free babysitter and delicious food? :P</p>\n<center>**Love you Amma! <3**< center=\"\">\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/qvuujqsw2q4cswg2630ahefurw3iyfnt.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>(While you're at it, you should also <a href=\"http://uppukhara.com\">check out her blog here</a>! It's basically every recipe she made for me growing up that I have random cravings for since I've moved out to California.)</p>\n<p>Sometimes I feel like I'm not a complete adult yet. Even though I'm currently supporting myself, paying my own bills, taxes, and insurance, I don't always feel like a &quot;real&quot; adult. Then, there are times when suddenly I feel like a full on housewife, which is something I NEVER EVER want to be.</p>\n<p>One such instance was this past weekend, when I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of my new electric pressure cooker. One thing I'm <em>sure</em> every child growing up in an Indian household can relate to, is the sound of a pressure cooker. That sound TERRIFIED me to my core throughout my childhood, and to this day. I always feel like something somewhere is going to explode. Even in college when my roommate decided to make dal and turned on the pressure cooker, we used to hide behind our bedroom doors waiting for it to go off enough times so could turn it off and continue hiding. You'd think that it wouldn't be worth the fear, but honestly have you ever had dal or even better, Bangalore-style saaru? Yea, it's worth it. (If you're wondering what that is, it's a less liquidy and better version of rasam with more dal in it). I've tried all sorts of cooking techniques, but saaru just doesn't taste quite the same unless you use a pressure cooker. And this way, you don't end up wasting hours and hours making your meal. THAT is not worth it.</p>\n<p>The sound of our pressure cooker is even worse for our dog because he can hear the noise WAY before we can. He panics and runs all the way up the stairs and cowers near my parent's bedroom door. This happens without fail every time my mom STARTS the pressure cooker. He knows it's coming and refuses to come down from his hiding spot until he's completely sure it's not going to go off again. Poor baby. But I'm sure you'll all realize why once you get your own pressure cookers!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/btjgsul6c32hvenzfsw74q4e2xc34mi3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>But AHA! What is this?! An ELECTRIC pressure cooker? What is this magical device? So quiet and effective? Truly this can't be real! But miraculously, IT IS!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51jpKXz6EuL._AC_UL320_SR308,320_.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I've never been so excited for any adult purchase in my life, except <em>maybe</em> my car. This was a glorious purchase. NOT ONLY can it make dal in 4 minutes, but I can use it to make dahi (yogurt or curds generally eaten with indian food), rice, and basically anything else in life I could ever think of! ALL WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND! I didn't even realize it had even started and it made a beeping noise indicating that my food was READY! It's wonderful.</p>\n<p>Amidst all this excitement over the pressure cooker, I got kind of homesick for my mom's food. I then proceeded to facetime my mom for an hour while she carefully explained step by step instructions on how to make one of my favorite childhood dishes, Bendekai Huli or for you non-Kannada speaking people out there, Okra Sambar. Most kids hate okra, but honestly it's one of my favorite vegetables, especially when it's in Indian food.</p>\n<p>I know this might not be the most flattering picture of any of us (mainly my brother) but whatever.</p>\n<p>One thing I will mention is that I am not sure where to get the huli pudi (sambar powder). My parents usually bring bags back from this little store in Bangalore every time anyone visits, but I'm sure you can find something similar in local Indian stores. I mean, I know I couldn't live without sambar so I'm sure there are other people who feel the same way and have found a way! There are also instant mixes available at the Indian store - while these aren't quite as good, they can satisfy the occasional craving!</p>\n<p>Now that you've learned a little bit of Kannada, and hopefully are as excited as I was, let's begin!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/gqm35vb6v2zox6pbikr2rrwd7fwe0y6u.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Okra Sambar or Bendekai Huli</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>I'm giving these instructions based on my electric pressure cooker.
