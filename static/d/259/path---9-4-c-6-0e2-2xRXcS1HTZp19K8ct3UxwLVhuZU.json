You can also use store bought stock, as that is likely far less labor intensive! If you don't mind chicken or beef broth, feel free to use one of those instead and add some cooked shredded chicken or beef too.</p>\n<p>Next, you want to prepare your noodles - you can buy premade rice noodles, or get dry noodles and cook them yourself.
