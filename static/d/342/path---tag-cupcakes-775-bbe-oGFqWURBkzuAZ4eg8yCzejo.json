YAY Post #2 for the week! And that too, to celebrate one of the nerdiest holidays out there! STAR WARS DAY!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/4PbEHW8mN4xhK/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>All the wonderful puns.</p>\n<p>Also because this recipe is banana filled, I HAD the little song by the Minions from Despicable Me stuck in my head. So I figured I should share that adorableness and mental torture with you guys.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3\">\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" wmode=\"Opaque\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sFukyIIM1XI?wmode=transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>Anyways... after being home sick for an entire week in what I consider my personal version of solitary confinement, I hit a new level of insanity. I was deprived of social interaction to such a point that I legit LOL'd at a Buzzfeed article of ridiculous snapchats for a good 20 minutes. And by LOL'd I mean curled over laughing so hard I could barely breathe. No Buzzfeed article is THAT funny. I had such bad sinus pain that working on my computer for long periods of time was pretty rough. So I decided rather than wallowing in my bed, I was going to make SOME productive use of my time... baking for you guys!</p>\n<p>I found this recipe on Pinterest a while back of <a href=\"http://www.carlsbadcravings.com/cream-cheese-stuffed-chocolate-chip-banana-coffee-cake-recipe/\">Cream Cheese Filled Chocolate Chip Banana Coffee Cake</a>. I do want to preface my recipe with this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I didn't some of the ingredients so this is my altered version for lazy bakers :)</li>\n<li>I also don't have a bundt cake pan, so mine didn't come out as gorgeous looking as this but there is one thing I CAN guarantee, which is that they came out DELICIOUS. Probably one of my favorite desserts I've ever made, next to Tiramisu and my mom's Mush Cake.</li>\n<li>I didn't have brown sugar and didn't want to bother making a second grocery store trip for that so I just didn't bother making the streusel topping that was in the original recipe. I can only imagine how much more mind blowing it would have been had I added the streusel, maybe you can make yours with it and let me know!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/1tjouximy6nxjmeaomjqkrsd4i5ouqxi.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Over the last few weeks I've been trying to figure out where in my new apartment I can do my food photography to optimize the natural light coming from my windows. In my old apartment it was extremely easy, I had giant sliding doors which brought in ALL the light and shown over pretty much my entire living room; and if that wasn't enough then I could go out onto my balcony and take the photos there! It was perfect. This week I discovered that if I angle one of my side tables properly and place the dish inside it, the light reflects off the walls of the table perfectly onto the the food and really brings out all the details in the food! I HAD FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT! Although this weird positioning did lead to some old people back pain for me because of the weird positions that I laid in on the floor to get these photos. Such is the pain for beauty.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/l2l9lmho8q088kczuewl9ll8ec4uz2b8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I mean just look at it...</p>\n<p>This is one recipe I would HIGHLY recommend you try, whether it be my interpretation or the original recipe itself.

And I figured if I made them all blue and yellow then all the better... GO BLUE! I looked at the recipe, saw the ingredients and was confident that this dessert was within my range of baking abilities. In fact, I was SO confident that I called a friend of mine to come over and reap the benefits of my baking!</p>\n<p>Clearly such confidence could only yield brilliant results.</p>\n<p><strong>WRONG</strong></p>\n<p>Making macarons is a very delicate process that requires a lot more patience and skill than I had ever anticipated! And for that very reason, the adorable macarons I had been picturing in my head came out like this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JjfOtdZpKGPUnJWQXW5VSqnS-09Xoi1kbel7l62Q72S2=w1756-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Exactly like you picture macarons in French Patisseries right?! I know... I was just as disappointed as you. It basically became some strange almond flavored fruit roll ups. Not at all appetizing. Now there was another problem... I had a <strong>TON</strong> of almond batter that clearly wasn't going to make macarons and no idea what to do with it. My cousin saved my ass and suggested I just convert them into almond cupcakes.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I think it was my disappointment at failing to make macrons but I half heartedly made these cupcakes. So much so that I didn't even bother with my usual photo shoot of the final masterpiece. I have absolutely no photos of what they turned out to look like. Nada. Zilch. But imagine they looked something like this except light yellow and blue with little almond specs all inside.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.afarmgirlsdabbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/530_IMG_7507_white-cupcakes.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>They weren't especially sweet cupcakes so I figured they needed some kind of topping to balance out the flavors. I went back and made some of my handy caramel bourbon sauce, which is just melted caramel, a little water, and some <a href=\"http://www.southerncomfort.com/age?ref=caramel\">Caramel Southern Comfort</a>. First off, it's heavenly and just a little boozy. Secondly, it basically takes you 2 minutes to make.</p>\n<p>Finally having somewhat salvaged this disaster, I took the box of what I thought was my failures to work. After keeping it out in the lounge area, I quickly learned that the combination of almond cupcakes with caramel bourbon sauce works.... like <strong>really</strong> works.</p>\n<p>Anyways, here's what I think was the makeshift cupcake recipe. More or less...</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>\"Macaron\" Almond Cupcakes</h2>\n    <em>If the consistency doesn't seem like normal cupcake batter, add more flour.

No one could have answered that question better than Amy Poehler herself, &quot;it's only the best day of the year. Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home, and we just come and kick it, breakfast-style. Ladies celebrating ladies. It's like Lilith Fair, minus the angst. Plus frittatas.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ever year on Valentine's Day, my mom sends me a special gift. When I lived it at home, she used to give me and my brother cute small stuffed animals with hearts on them. When I moved to Ann Arbor for college, she took a different approach. Every year, she would send me a heart shaped pizza with my favorite toppings, MUSHROOMS!</p>\n<p>This past Valentine's Day, however, I was in India so neither was possible. So my cousins and I decided to celebrate Galentine's Day instead! We made some delicious red velvet cupcakes from scratch, enjoyed some leftover batter, and watched some light hearted chick flicks. All in all, a great way to celebrate our fellow ladies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8625/16587351126_1c46565bdc_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We were pretty lazy about experimenting with the recipe so I will just leave you with <a href=\"http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2014/10/29/red-velvet-cupcakes/\">the recipe we used</a> for the cupcakes and made a basic chocolate icing following the instructions on the bag of confectioners sugar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/16587382106_5c03caf20b_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8562/16426167478_8bc9ab2160_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8652/16612747142_14252b62a0_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&quot;February 14th, Valentine's Day, is about romance.
