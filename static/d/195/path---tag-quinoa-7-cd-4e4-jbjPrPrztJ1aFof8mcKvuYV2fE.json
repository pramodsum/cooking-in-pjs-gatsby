Usually that ends up being some simple pasta, vegetable fajitas, or toppings on a veggie burger. This time, I figured, why not try something different and make a veggie patty using these vegetables!</p>\n<p>It ended up being some kind of frittata/omelets/burger patty thing. While I may not be entirely sure what to call it, it tasted wonderful. And to my delight, it photographed really well! I actually ate the patty by itself but you could definitely eat these inside a burger or chopped up in a salad. So many options!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8577/16636556891_1f78750ce7_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8670/16018075843_3491552743_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <span class=\"item\">\n      <h2 class=\"fn\">Quinoa Veggie Patty</h2>\n    </span>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Recipe inspired by  http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/epic-crispy-quinoa-burgers-topped-sweet-potato-fries-beer-caramelized-onions-gruyere/</em></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup cooked red quinoa</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup chopped mushroom</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup sliced zucchini</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup sliced squash</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup sliced red onion</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 handful baby spinach</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp red pepper flakes or dash of cayenne</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">salt and pepper to taste</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">lime slices for garnishing</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">chopped green onion for garnishing</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        Mix all ingredients together and roll into medium-sized balls.
