The music, the dancing, and let's not forget Diego Luna. In honor of Diego Luna and his amazing dancing, play the song below while you read this post.

However last month when me and my family went to Cancun for a week, I knew I had been missing out on something big. The amazing flavors of corn tortillas, super flavorful meat (or beans for you vegetarians), fresh salsas and Crema Mexicana mesh together for a completely different experience of eating simple tacos. Now that I had officially been converted to a taco snob, I was determined to only eat the best of tacos I could find.</p>\n<p>Conveniently the bay area is filled with the most amazing food, especially when it comes to taco trucks. Each taco truck I've visited usually has a side of a few salsas. I was determined to recreate two of my favorite taco truck salsas, an avocado tomatillo salsa and a spicy red chili salsa, as authentic as possible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8743/17335026415_ff5458c370_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I found a few recipes online, and experimented on my own and finally ended up with these recipes!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7661/17327373531_b39d8028ec_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Avocado Tomatillo Salsa</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to adjust the number of chilis based on your own spice tolerance.

No one could have answered that question better than Amy Poehler herself, &quot;it's only the best day of the year. Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home, and we just come and kick it, breakfast-style. Ladies celebrating ladies. It's like Lilith Fair, minus the angst. Plus frittatas.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ever year on Valentine's Day, my mom sends me a special gift. When I lived it at home, she used to give me and my brother cute small stuffed animals with hearts on them. When I moved to Ann Arbor for college, she took a different approach. Every year, she would send me a heart shaped pizza with my favorite toppings, MUSHROOMS!</p>\n<p>This past Valentine's Day, however, I was in India so neither was possible. So my cousins and I decided to celebrate Galentine's Day instead! We made some delicious red velvet cupcakes from scratch, enjoyed some leftover batter, and watched some light hearted chick flicks. All in all, a great way to celebrate our fellow ladies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8625/16587351126_1c46565bdc_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We were pretty lazy about experimenting with the recipe so I will just leave you with <a href=\"http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2014/10/29/red-velvet-cupcakes/\">the recipe we used</a> for the cupcakes and made a basic chocolate icing following the instructions on the bag of confectioners sugar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/16587382106_5c03caf20b_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8562/16426167478_8bc9ab2160_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8652/16612747142_14252b62a0_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&quot;February 14th, Valentine's Day, is about romance. But February 13th, Galentine's Day, is about celebrating lady friends.

I usually just end up making really small quantities which barely justifies all the ingredients I would have needed to get to make the desserts. At work I noticed that anytime someone brought in donuts or anything else, people would hunt the food down and devour it. Figuring this the was the best opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, so I whipped up a few batches of the brownies and brought them to work.</p>\n<p>First, I sent an email to my team and only a few people grabbed some. I thought I had made a complete mistake making so many brownies, or maybe I was delusional about how the brownies tasted since I had made them. As a last option, I sent an email out to the whole company and left them in the common area of my floor. Twenty minutes later when I went to go check on them, I saw an empty box. Clearly the brownies had been a huge hit! Now that I've found the perfect group to sample all of my treats, I can bake without worries! My coworkers can expect a flood of baked goods at least once a month from here on out while I use them as guinea pigs for all the different desserts I've always wanted to make! :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7711/17154413587_86e925b5aa_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7766/16741602133_ec8f6f5fc7_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Personally, I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake, but these little bites are amazing. At first when I bit into one, it was perfectly gooey and chocolatey and with a little bit of cheesecake to top off the flavor. I honestly wasn't sure if I hadn't cooked them all the way, but after thoroughly inspecting and devouring a few, I realized that that's just the way the brownies cook! Each brownie was perfectly gooey yet filled with flavors just melting in your mouth. The cheesecake portion was the perfect compliment for the sweetness of the brownies. Try the recipe yourself and let me know how you like it!</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Chocolate Chip Cheesecake Brownie Bites</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <h4>Brownie Part:</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ cup melted unsalted butter</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup sugar</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 large eggs</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ cup all-purpose flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>\n      <h4>Cheesecake Part:</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">8 oz softened cream cheese</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ cup sugar</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg yolk</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Mix the eggs into this mixture until the batter is fully mixed.

Add a spoonful of cheesecake batter on top of the brownie batter in each well and swirl the cheesecake and brownie parts together! Put the pan in the oven and bake for about 20 minutes (I used a 24 mini cupcake pan so it was 20 minutes for me but if you have use a smaller/larger pan adjust the time accordingly). </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8770/16741596333_b8c6088247_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8887/17335899916_10f36cfbeb_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7699/17335896446_efebc5dfbc_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"Little Bites of Heaven","slug":"little-bites-of-heaven","published_at":"05 May, 2015","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8772/17361867465_b5793fb7f7_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c272","slug":"cheesecake"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c273","slug":"brownies"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c274","slug":"mini"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c275","slug":"swirl"}]}}}
