And I figured if I made them all blue and yellow then all the better... GO BLUE! I looked at the recipe, saw the ingredients and was confident that this dessert was within my range of baking abilities. In fact, I was SO confident that I called a friend of mine to come over and reap the benefits of my baking!</p>\n<p>Clearly such confidence could only yield brilliant results.</p>\n<p><strong>WRONG</strong></p>\n<p>Making macarons is a very delicate process that requires a lot more patience and skill than I had ever anticipated! And for that very reason, the adorable macarons I had been picturing in my head came out like this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JjfOtdZpKGPUnJWQXW5VSqnS-09Xoi1kbel7l62Q72S2=w1756-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Exactly like you picture macarons in French Patisseries right?! I know... I was just as disappointed as you. It basically became some strange almond flavored fruit roll ups. Not at all appetizing. Now there was another problem... I had a <strong>TON</strong> of almond batter that clearly wasn't going to make macarons and no idea what to do with it. My cousin saved my ass and suggested I just convert them into almond cupcakes.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I think it was my disappointment at failing to make macrons but I half heartedly made these cupcakes. So much so that I didn't even bother with my usual photo shoot of the final masterpiece. I have absolutely no photos of what they turned out to look like. Nada. Zilch. But imagine they looked something like this except light yellow and blue with little almond specs all inside.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.afarmgirlsdabbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/530_IMG_7507_white-cupcakes.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>They weren't especially sweet cupcakes so I figured they needed some kind of topping to balance out the flavors. I went back and made some of my handy caramel bourbon sauce, which is just melted caramel, a little water, and some <a href=\"http://www.southerncomfort.com/age?ref=caramel\">Caramel Southern Comfort</a>. First off, it's heavenly and just a little boozy. Secondly, it basically takes you 2 minutes to make.</p>\n<p>Finally having somewhat salvaged this disaster, I took the box of what I thought was my failures to work. After keeping it out in the lounge area, I quickly learned that the combination of almond cupcakes with caramel bourbon sauce works.... like <strong>really</strong> works.</p>\n<p>Anyways, here's what I think was the makeshift cupcake recipe. More or less...</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>\"Macaron\" Almond Cupcakes</h2>\n    <em>If the consistency doesn't seem like normal cupcake batter, add more flour.

Cronut Fever. A chef in New York City decided that he would take croissant dough and fry it like a donut. This scrumptious flaky dessert became <strong>SO</strong> popular that there was even a black market for them! People would pay $100 on the black market for a cronut that could be bought for $5 if they waited in line for a day.</p>\n<p>I'd never tasted a cronut before in my life, so I decided to make use of a bunch of stale croissants I had lying around after a road trip. I tore the croissants into bite size pieces and fried them in hot oil and count to 4. Quickly flip each cronut and fry again for 4 counts. Make sure not to cook them for too long or they get a little too crunchy and burn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uItKVRYVHXTTy-8axm084k_HfxLO6xzEZdPLVsRCD4KB=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Place the fried bites onto paper towels to drain any excess oil. When cooled, drizzle with any icing of your choice or enjoy them by themselves!</p>\n<p>They were flaky yet crunchy, salty yet buttery. It was amazing! I completely understand what the fuss was in New York City at the time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t7G8JSAQTWhF4tYo7phZ4pW0JmJUR3wW9tfbTtKWJiYd=s800\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jSVFKsebGkxhYqNYuiNsVIhtieIrE3c0NZTu-IJJw5VK=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>However, I learned a few things while making these. Making them with store-bought croissants is fine, however you get the proper ratio of flakiness to fried crunchiness when you use croissant dough. It is also easier not to burn them while frying when you use dough. I am not a huge fan of too much oil, so frying the croissants wasn't my favorite. Maybe there's a way to shallow fry them where they won't pick up too much oil, but I have no idea. Next time I try making cronut bites, I will try to bake store-bought croissants and see if that makes a difference. Who knows!</p>\n<p>For the mean time, I completely suggest you try making these at home! They're simple to make and taste amazing! If you're too lazy then I'd recommend going to your local pastry shop and seeing if they make something similar!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_h3gaGiFbUHaUe_a9dnjOu6yMLoZv8oXEt19I2f1god5=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"Well Son, When a Croissant Loves a Donut...","slug":"well-son-when-a-croissant-loves-a-donut","published_at":"27 June, 2015","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I3bLdLcbLHBZH2QIeDqAX55etYu-5I1Tz94-7LJ62KRW=s800","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23d","slug":"brunch"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23f","slug":"breakfast"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c27d","slug":"donuts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c283","slug":"cronut"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c284","slug":"fried"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c285","slug":"croissant"}]},"next":{"html":"<p>So if you hadn't already seen, I EPICALLY failed at making macarons this past weekend.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JjfOtdZpKGPUnJWQXW5VSqnS-09Xoi1kbel7l62Q72S2=w1756-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This just made me all the more determined to get them right.

It I guess technically was macarons but i wasn't able to get the perfect bubble shape. I was determined to perfect this recipe!</p>\n<p>THE MACARONS CANNOT WIN!</p>\n<p>So I set out to make batch 3. This time I let the egg whites &quot;age&quot; for a few days before using them. And I decided that I would try to be patient and actually wait for the meringue to be COMPLETELY done. I had gotten closer last time but not enough.</p>\n<p>What basically followed was me obsessively watching videos on how to make the perfect macarons. (I've provided some of those links here) My cousin literally thought I was insane because I watched videos for a good hour (okay maybe it was actually 2 hours... don't judge me).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://foodnouveau.com/destinations/europe/france/how-to-make-macarons-a-detailed-illustrated-step-by-step-recipe/\">http://foodnouveau.com/destinations/europe/france/how-to-make-macarons-a-detailed-illustrated-step-by-step-recipe/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foodiebaker.com/chocolate-macarons/\">http://www.foodiebaker.com/chocolate-macarons/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bri6xnDBl9I\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bri6xnDBl9I</a></p>\n<p>There are also TONS of other videos on youtube but let's be honest here... how many of you will actually be attempting to make these.

WAY too much effort in my opinion.</p>\n<p>However, they were quite tasty. Nicely crunchy yet light. We slathered some peanut butter and munched on a few macaron, or I guess in my case macaron-adjacents.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iOCibvCoZE8a1-lZfTuq58-efARuocQUpkjoBY3hg9Mj=w1996-h1498-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rqfEl9XDGtpP-gwzIITnumxEeg3G0Gc0CWxCdS8SpKSj=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>(Yes yes I know I spelled it wrong...
