It's also important to have a good rice to lentil ratio. You want to make sure that approximately one third of the total quantity is rice, so if you have two cups combined of lentils and legumes, you would want one cup of rice in there.\n      These dosas can be eaten with yogurt, any chutney or pickle you like, or, if you're so inclined, plain. They would also be wonderful with sauteed vegetables. </em></p>\n      <p>Yield: Approximately 10 10-inch dosas, 3 - 4 servings</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"time\">\n      <p><strong>Total Time:</strong> <span class=\"duration\">1 hour active, 12 hours passive</span></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup black beans</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup chana dal</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup toor dal</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup split peas</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup brown rice</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/2 tbls fresh ginger</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 tbls whole black pepper</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 tbls cumin</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup coconut (dry and fresh both fine)</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 bunch cilantro</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">fresh green chili, to taste</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">salt, to taste</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>\n1.) Soak the black beans the night before, and start soaking the lentils about six hours before you want to eat them. \n</p><p>\n2.) Combine all ingredients including spices in the food processor with the water you soaked them in, and let it run. The resulting mixture shouldn't be too runny or too thick, and will be a little grainy, but not chunky. While it won't be as smooth as pancake batter, the lentils should be broken down quite well. \n</p><p>\n3.) Once your batter is ready, turn on your stove and let a skillet heat with a small amount of oil. You want the skillet to be hot and the oil covering the surface - if you put your batter on the skillet too soon it will stick! Put a small amount of batter in the center of your skillet, and careful spread it out with a spiraling motion until it's the desired size. Pour a small amount of oil (1/4 teaspoon) on the surface of the dosa, and then cover the pan. \n</p><p>\n4.) Let it cook for three - four minutes, before removing the cover, and flipping the dosa so the other side can cook.\n</p><p>\n5.) Cooking time varies based on the stove and the pan you're using, so give yourself a bit of leeway here. If your first dosa falls apart (as mine did) scrape it off, rinse your skillet, and start fresh - with a bit of trial and error, these become super easy! Once both sides of your dosa are cooked, it's ready! Pull up a plate and dig in :)\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>","title":"It's DOSA TIME.","slug":"ada-dosa","published_at":"11 January, 2016","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KWBBMYdzG5jqFpPXoOT5tZ1XsclaWzt3q4QXau3omGevmZidRFmpBSyJzvwum8K3YWVTaBFm3A4sgYrTCSYsfqErYq2A1UvLd7xEfm7jSmFkzQUUmjkEVWf5aySOjbmoQApXNZcDaBjGOb19JaK_mmg2KemL_-8Ggno5E-Rzck0QJLwUvBIT_ocr1v_V7iMgvSFZWO5OuPz0fDLU4XpknoQc0F5mueX1giHpDA3HHrUSSys4zeK5hyDv6iyyLnoYi5FbHl7dpEkG4DRQRv0cZvMa3LL_j-sfWNdD6mCGBQvyZFN3txUUgf6TDvqlC--0GXgzZAXVLP-G6Fnu2KK5qXXXJUPjkQz8quqmgBlA317IANaRjhBJ8gSFvd-2WYHySPHE7SPadbtaA6tbxGPxrEFppYuar1bLl4Lw3LbG-ieBLG0Gb_b1QED316YX4aN9VErOpOgI-9IxxhPjWOUIovADqIdpB9U0haOTqsOWUTbUO-kSAN5Zjh05RIqfUhco5hrzNw_Y4B5bQqR-E0OQ6X0e2xOMV5Xo9PWVUA-JxlsQSCb1NNlymaRk_5oR5xKXofyX=w362-h643-no","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ac","slug":"dosa"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ad","slug":"indian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}}}
