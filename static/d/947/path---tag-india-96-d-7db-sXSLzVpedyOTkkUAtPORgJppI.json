When I was there, I ate a ton of food. All of my family members were happy to feed me, and between the amazing home cooking, and the delicious food available on every street corner, it's almost a miracle that I didn't pack on pounds.</p>\n<p>I am, generally, pretty picky about my food. I waver between being vegan and vegetarian, and I'm usually pretty careful about ingredients I allow in my kitchen. But, like everyone else, I have a fatal flaw and it's this; I love street food.</p>\n<p>I know that someone involved didn't wash their hands, I know that the ingredients aren't always top notch, I know that the fat, salt, and sugar content is probably WAY higher than anything I should be consuming. But I don't particularly care.</p>\n<p>In India a &quot;gaadi&quot; is a vehicle, and &quot;chaat&quot; is street food that has fresh vegetable, puffed rice, sweet and spicy sauces, and some fried components. So &quot;gaadi chaat&quot; is street food you get out of a flat bed cart.</p>\n<p>In Bangalore, there's a street people refer to as &quot;chaat street,&quot; and the street is lined with street food vendors. One end has a bakery, and the other end (the end I like to start on) has a few fruit carts, and one &quot;corn&quot; cart. I usually get my corn spiced with salt and chili, and mixed with raw, unripe mangoes (delicious!)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zw9hrme823kt4bmwzy4plu5w9jcwdkmz.jpg\" alt=\"imagine yummy food here, cuz you're missing it!\"></p>\n<p>Then it's time for Masala Chaat! This is one of my absolute favorites; it features a thick, spicy lentil soup layered atop crispy, crackly puris (indian &quot;chips&quot; and under sweet and spicy chutney, some fresh onion and cilantro, and a sprinkle of &quot;chaat masala.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/gmg1xnscaj3hsaqurjkezft7d1pn8rbj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It's The Chaat Shop!</p>\n<p>Next up: Gobi Manchurian. Cauliflower dipped in dough and deep fried, then dredged in fresh onion and cilantro, and delicious, spicy, tomato-ey garlic-y sauces.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/oolk1yrswjqb9wmq7piboh797nv9lkii.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This is the Gobi Manchurian man! He also makes noodles. He is obviously supremely talented.</p>\n<p>Now that you're ALMOST too full (because you've eaten your way down the street) it's time for dessert! There's a bakery you can step into, vendors with all kinds of sweets and shaved ice, and (my personal favorite) Mango Kulfi!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/g5tfhr9guqtbm7tlinl65rw3eqdczkk8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Go to bed.

A year ago, I was in India, probably eating chaat (Indian street food), or taking pictures of my cousins while they danced around with stuffed animals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/jvexx1342qglctv9kb1ta3zhtc6tqmsc.jpg\" alt=\"You're missing a picture of a SUPERCUTE baby\"></p>\n<p>I miss India a lot. I always loved visiting my family there, and going for eight months was one of the most valuable times in my life. I loved every minute of it.</p>\n<p>This is a post about a breakfast place in Bangalore, Karnataka, India that everyone goes to. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/2xh4t94tv5kvay59fg04rz4uoczsmdsi.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Every city has this restaurant. It's not classically pretty, and there's no one waiting at the door to see whether or not you want to come in. This is a place where you have to leave your diet at the door (no one has any idea how many calories/protein grams/vats of butter are in your food anyway). The waiters are inattentive enough that a newcomer would have left on the spot, and there are literally never enough seats. There are a few places like this in Bangalore (in a city this big, with this much traffic, you need multiple choice breakfast spots), but Vidhyarthi Bhavan is arguably one of the most delicious.</p>\n<p>It's packed to the brim every day; I went on a Monday morning, and we had to stand behind people to snake their seats. And after we ate, people were standing behind us to snake ours. The restaurant is famous for it's Masala Dosa, although there are a couple of other items on the menu if you're interested.</p>\n<p>While you wait for your order, there are gorgeous photos of Mount Kailash, and really interesting pencil sketches of famous poets and writers of India adorning the walls.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/7opvixkr40x5e2k575lrbpy8rqnqnf1f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There's plenty of fodder for people watching, if the smells wafting from the kitchen aren't enough to keep you totally occupied. Finally, your order comes out.</p>\n<p>The dosas come to you on plates piled high in the waiter's arms (you have a brief moment where you are concerned that the bottom of someone else's plate has been all over your food); the waiter never actually looks at you before he heads to the next table. Then a second waiter, arguably less attentive than the first, comes over with a tureen of coconut, cilantro, and mint chutney and pours it onto your plate.</p>\n<p>You dig in with your fingers, barely resisting the urge to just dig in with your whole face. Finishing one of these babies is a task and a half, but you are definitely up to the challenge; going, going...gone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/by56r0iw8pjezazv9tvz46spa9zyx530.jpg\" alt=\"yummy yummy masale dosa!\"></p>\n<p>Finally, you get a cup of some excellent filter coffee to finish you right off, before you stumble into the daylight, and onto a street lined with flower and fruit merchants.</p>\n<p>You amble along, sniffing deeply and enjoying the almost-too-full-but-not-quite feeling in your stomach, and all feels right with the world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/7orlyigfozthf1tuoxjuo4cmt4etxsxh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/by56r0iw8pjezazv9tvz46spa9zyx530.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c245","name":"india","slug":"india"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ca","name":"masala dosa","slug":"masala-dosa"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","name":"eating out","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cb","name":"indian food","slug":"indian-food"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cc","name":"south indian","slug":"south-indian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cd","name":"bangalore","slug":"bangalore"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ce","name":"vidhyarthi bhavan","slug":"vidhyarthi-bhavan"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cf","name":"nostalgia","slug":"nostalgia"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d0","name":"homesick","slug":"homesick"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c357","uuid":"37a98e77-e446-4f06-bbf8-6fbc1677f180","title":"The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making FAJITAS!!","url":"https://cookinginpjs.herokuapp.com/im-making-fajitas/","published_at":"14 January, 2016","html":"<p>We all love Ross.

For example, McDonald's in India actually has completely vegetarian options. Due to the <strong>large</strong> population of vegetarians in India, McDonald's has 2 segregated kitchens for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. In addition, they don't serve any beef items, in contrast to the McDonald's in the US, which is primarily beef burgers. Honestly, I love McDonald's in India! They've managed to merge Indian flavors into simple American burgers and come out with amazing dishes such as the McSpicy Paneer and McAloo Tiki Burger. If you haven't yet, you should definitely try the McSpicy Paneer Burger, it's my favorite! :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7447/16213447308_f042572573_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>My cousin recently had a major craving for Mexican food. The only problem is that we're in India and the Mexican food available doesn't taste quite the same nor as authentic. In order to quench our cravings, we even tried going to Taco Bell, which has a new item called the Paneer Tikka Masala Burrito! Unfortunately the menu had been too Indianized and no longer tasted Mexican. While this style of Taco Bell is very popular with people in India, it doesn't quite measure up to the Taco Bell we have in the US.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p240x240/10500572_10153058890499813_8118498097049613786_n.jpg?oh=045ce9ccadee439cd72f5918fcb7bb3e&amp;oe=55583775&amp;__gda__=1431596238_63eebcd5fe7f4c135a000227d439d70b\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Our best bet was to figure out how to make it our selves. Unfortunately we did run into a few bumps along the road:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is a lot harder to find iceberg lettuce in Bangalore than originally suspected. Iceberg lettuce isn't really in any kind of Indian food therefore only available at some special markets rather than on every street vegetable cart.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7448/16375097256_ab5794a54c_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Many people tend to substitute dahi for sour cream out of convenience, however, this doesn't have quite the same taste. Conveniently, we found a fairly easy <a href=\"http://www.tarladalal.com/Sour-Cream-(--Wraps-and-Rolls)-32623r\">recipe</a> on how to make our own homemade sour cream! <a href=\"http://www.tarladalal.com\">Tarla Dalal</a> to the rescue!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8601/16400164382_73d99cfb83_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Making the refried beans for the tacos ended up being extremely time consuming. If I had been in the US, I could have just bought a can of beans, cooked them with some cumin and cayene pepper and been done with it. I completely took for granted the preparation needed to make refried beans. First you needed to soak and cook the beans until they were soft, and then cook them in a pan with the appropriate seasoning. This took much longer than I had originally expected.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7400/15778603364_95408ed417_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We realized even making tortillas by hand wouldn't be so bad. Every morning, the cook at my grandparents house makes chapatis from scratch. Tortillas are esentially chapatis made from normal flour, not wheat. So my grandmother quickly whipped up a huge ball of dough for us to roll out and make into tortillas.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8588/16213679700_5c8738a6f2_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8606/16375090146_29515989da_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/16214852339_c9de429d99_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>No taco would be complete without salsa! We made 2 different types of salsa, corn with jalapenos and pico de gallo salsa. Both salsas are extremely easy to make. For the corn salsa, you just need to combine boiled sweet corn kernels, diced jalapenos, lemon juice, salt, and some cilantro. Mix it together and viola! You have salsa. Similarly, if you mix diced tomatoes and onions, minced garlic, cilantro, and lemon juice you get pico de gallo salsa. Both can be made very quickly and are fresh and delicious!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7299/16375094646_260f9aa406_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7444/15781043603_80df9ccbbd_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Surprisingly everything turned out really tasty and me and my cousin happily enjoyed delicious Mexican food for the next 2 days! :) My cousin loved it so much, she ate it for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner for the next 2 days.
