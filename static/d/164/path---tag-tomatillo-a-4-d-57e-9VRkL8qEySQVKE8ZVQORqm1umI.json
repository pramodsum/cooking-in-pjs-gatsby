The music, the dancing, and let's not forget Diego Luna. In honor of Diego Luna and his amazing dancing, play the song below while you read this post. Now that you've set the mood, let's get started.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3\">\n<iframe height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\" wmode=\"Opaque\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com//embed/sC5wFByeqn8?wmode=transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>Having lived in Michigan most of my life, I've been used to eating sub par Mexican food and grew to love that. However last month when me and my family went to Cancun for a week, I knew I had been missing out on something big. The amazing flavors of corn tortillas, super flavorful meat (or beans for you vegetarians), fresh salsas and Crema Mexicana mesh together for a completely different experience of eating simple tacos. Now that I had officially been converted to a taco snob, I was determined to only eat the best of tacos I could find.</p>\n<p>Conveniently the bay area is filled with the most amazing food, especially when it comes to taco trucks. Each taco truck I've visited usually has a side of a few salsas. I was determined to recreate two of my favorite taco truck salsas, an avocado tomatillo salsa and a spicy red chili salsa, as authentic as possible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8743/17335026415_ff5458c370_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I found a few recipes online, and experimented on my own and finally ended up with these recipes!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7661/17327373531_b39d8028ec_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Avocado Tomatillo Salsa</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to adjust the number of chilis based on your own spice tolerance.
