No one could have answered that question better than Amy Poehler herself, &quot;it's only the best day of the year. Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home, and we just come and kick it, breakfast-style. Ladies celebrating ladies. It's like Lilith Fair, minus the angst. Plus frittatas.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ever year on Valentine's Day, my mom sends me a special gift. When I lived it at home, she used to give me and my brother cute small stuffed animals with hearts on them. When I moved to Ann Arbor for college, she took a different approach. Every year, she would send me a heart shaped pizza with my favorite toppings, MUSHROOMS!</p>\n<p>This past Valentine's Day, however, I was in India so neither was possible. So my cousins and I decided to celebrate Galentine's Day instead! We made some delicious red velvet cupcakes from scratch, enjoyed some leftover batter, and watched some light hearted chick flicks. All in all, a great way to celebrate our fellow ladies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8625/16587351126_1c46565bdc_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We were pretty lazy about experimenting with the recipe so I will just leave you with <a href=\"http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2014/10/29/red-velvet-cupcakes/\">the recipe we used</a> for the cupcakes and made a basic chocolate icing following the instructions on the bag of confectioners sugar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/16587382106_5c03caf20b_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8562/16426167478_8bc9ab2160_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8652/16612747142_14252b62a0_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&quot;February 14th, Valentine's Day, is about romance. But February 13th, Galentine's Day, is about celebrating lady friends. It's wonderful and it should be a national holiday.&quot;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leslie Knope</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8654/16587426526_d0f65cdbf7_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8573/16406140367_5c5b265be3_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c253","name":"cupcakes","slug":"cupcakes"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c254","name":"galentines day","slug":"galentines-day"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c256","name":"red velvet","slug":"red-velvet"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c257","name":"valentines day","slug":"valentines-day-2"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"galentines-day","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
