I've thrown all sorts of information in there and\ngiven it a good shake, and things are tumbling about pretty wildly right now.\n\nExam season is upon me, and I am not bearing up well under the stress. Just\ndon't ask me how many hot Cheetos I've consumed, because that could get super\nembarrassing super fast. My food consumption these days in 50% leftovers, 30%\neggs, 10% random free food, and 10% cheese, so you could say things are a bit\nmad right now.\n\nI'm so excited to finish the semester and start cooking again. In the meantime\nthough, I want to leave this recipe I made a bit ago here.\n\n\n\nI'd never made tofu scramble before, so there was quite a bit of googling\ninvolved. In the end, I came up with a recipe that hit all the right spots, and\nwas healthy to boot! I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys savory\nbreakfast, even the pledged carnivores; this tofu is delicious!\n\nTofu Scramble\nThere are two keys to making this a good recipe: (1) extremely firm tofu - the\nfirmest you can locate at the store, and (2) marinate it over night.\n\nYield: 2 servings\n\nTotal Time:  30 minutes\n\nIngredients:\nMarinade\n2 Tbsp Soy Sauce\n 2 Tbsp C Vinegar4 Tbsp Nutritional Year1 Tsp Garlic Powder1 Tsp Onion Powder\n Scramble\n1 Package Extremely Firm Tofu\n Handful of BroccoliHandful of Kale5-6 Mushrooms\n Directions:\n\n1.) Mix your marinade ingredients together, and add water if you need to so that\nit's not too thick. It should be roughly the consistency of gravy.\n\n  \n2.) Rip your tofu into bit sized chunks with forks or with your hands, and mix\nthe marinade into the tofu. Set the mixture in the fridge overnight.\n\n  \n3.) Chop your broccoli, kale, and mushrooms, and cook your veg - broccoli, then\nkale and mushrooms together. Be sure to add some salt and spices to the\nvegetables!\n\n  \n4.) When the vegetables are half cooked, create a space, and pour your tofu\nscramble in. Let it cook for a few minutes, 5-7 should be just enough.\n\n  \n5.) Pour into a bowl with some hashbrowns and enjoy!    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/tj5saknljx5vewphutanvgu2he6w75gg.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c318","name":"tofu","slug":"tofu"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23f","name":"breakfast","slug":"breakfast"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23d","name":"brunch","slug":"brunch"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c313","name":"savory","slug":"savory"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c319","name":"scramble","slug":"scramble"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31a","name":"noms","slug":"noms"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"scramble","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
