There are many phases of a best friend reunion, according to this <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/kelseydarragh/when-your-bff-comes-to-town#.nsbQEmYJq\">buzzfeed article</a>. Pretty much every single thing in that article happened, except in our friendship instead of drinking our weight in wine, we cook. And eat.</p>\n<p><strong>A LOT OF FOOD</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-12/8/18/enhanced/webdr11/anigif_original-21914-1449616517-5.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I'm pretty sure Anagha spent 50% of her time at my place and the other 50% at her own parents' house. We didn't even do anything most of the time... I would be working and she would be reading at the opposite end of the table. She had also never met the newest addition to my family, Miggy Pramod, who is basically the most adorable dog known to man.</p>\n<p>True to form, they became best friends immediately.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ijnjkbtgaycn5ddhbx2dwakh9gcrq3ua.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Seriously though, who couldn't love a weirdo that sleeps like this regularly?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/j1fczq8yhjzxhz0ae852f1lu4wqdp00s.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Just look at him.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/8429t2jqhh8zkgv3fuc8vszlqh3y8dbj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This past August, my dad decided that my mom's birthday gift would be to finally get a puppy. My entire family, brimming with excitement, spent hours and hours looking on petfinder.com and various shelter sites for the perfect little CALM addition to our family. After countless shelter visits and close calls with various puppies, we were extremely tired and disheartened. The process of finding the perfect dog for our family had become a lot more emotionally draining than we had originally thought. My mom wasn't sure if she could get attached to another dog and see him/her join another family. Then one day, my parents went to this small little animal hospital in Sterling Heights, MI and instantly became smitten with, what we were told, was a little beagle mix. He was an adorable 18 pound ball of affection who just wanted to play. One week later, he was ready to come home.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/dcypl744jtl2r4ey4gb8xydob6hi09g6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>He was a VERY little 5 month old puppy. Little did we know that the tiny little boy that we brought home was a little more German Shepherd than Beagle. Currently, Miggy is a happy 40 pounds and the obsession of my entire family, weird sleeping positions, ear licking fetishes and all.</p>\n<p>ANYWAYS putting the puppy love aside, whenever we weren't spoiling Miggles with never ending attention, we were watching Netflix and eating All The Brunch. If it hasn't become obvious from some of our <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/brunch-conquers-all/\">previous posts</a>, We <strong>LOVE</strong> brunch. Best of all, it means that we can roll out of bed in our pajamas and enjoy some scrumptiousness that we could concoct using eggs and veggies. Yay Pajamas! YAY Brunch!</p>\n<p>Then, it's time for a relaxing, vacation time food coma. There's that one episode of friends where Joey and Ross discover that they are each other's best nap buddies. Exactly. Who <em>DOESN'T</em> want a nap buddy and best of all your best friend?! So we spent most of our afternoons watching Netflix and chilling (no not like that you perv!) but literally watching Netflix reruns and napping with my puppy.</p>\n<p><strong>Best. Break. Ever.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://45.media.tumblr.com/78bddaf03bdfb59b75a09a3c3db38b10/tumblr_ngbxx0rIAb1snhpyjo1_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We also love Mexican food. No explanation needed. It's just the best. So OBVIOUSLY nothing could be better than combining the two things we are always craving. In came chilaquiles.</p>\n<p>I've had varieties of chilaquiles in the past. From the beaches of Cancun to the streets of San Francisco and San Diego. Everywhere, they put their own spin on the classic Mexican dish. Traditionally it's kept very simple with just fried tortillas, salsa, egg, and beans (and/or meat). California, on the other hand, tends to add avocado to everything so it's very colorful. Our variation probably includes WAY more vegetables than most but I love it and it tasted delicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fco4k8iom9446zmbd42f9dby9n7o3cmn.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/9r2pggwyj4j7fre2tlxu47nhkj2be8mh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/3g098w0hj52qe8k9d45ddalcfxo4a2oh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/eb3enu78qybtf2rl2qygx4gx64l9r7zn.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Chilaquiles</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 bottle <a href=\"http://www.lavictoria.com/products/salsa/thickn-chunky-salsa-verde-medium/\">Salsa Verde</a></li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 bag tortilla chips</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 can black beans</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\"><a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/estoy-cantando/\">Sumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning</a></li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 avocado cubed</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg per person</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">sour cream</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">cheese (shredded or Cotija)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">chopping cilantro to garnish</li>\n        <h4>Pico De Gallo Salsa</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 roma tomatoes</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 onion diced</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">lemon juice to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">salt to taste</li>\n        <h4>Corn Salsa</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 can sweet corn kernels</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">4 sliced jalape√±os (more or less based on your spice tolerance)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">lemon juice to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">salt to taste</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Put two handfuls of tortilla chips in a pan and cover with the salsa verde.
