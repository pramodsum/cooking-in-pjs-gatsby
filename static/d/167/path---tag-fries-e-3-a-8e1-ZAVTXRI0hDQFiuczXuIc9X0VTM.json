I know right?! So awesome. You can thank me later. AND to make things better... instead of sharing just a single song... I'm going to gift you with a whole playlist of my favorite songs from Coachella!</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A1217494097%3Aplaylist%3A7vHswNAsv4lLIjCNrjvzeZ\" width=\"auto\" max-width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>So very typical of me, I didn't double check my flight timings when booking so I ended up flying out to LAX a whole 10 hours before the rest of my group. I decided to start the trip out right, eggs Benedict and a mimosa at the airport with a side of Gilmore Girls.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/egnkhg8zefh3rl0xkh1co74s074cr4c0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Usually 10 hours stranded at an airport is a bummer, but there are worse places to get stranded than LAX. It kind of ended up working out for me because I took my camera and explored! I walked from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach and soaked in the gorgeous SoCal sun.</p>\n<p>In Santa Monica, I stopped at the Lobster for some AMAZING crab cake. Seriously, probably the best I've ever had in my life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/0i02gxp1jckp0svdv6cu8wi5ewctzsvm.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In Venice Beach, I decided to have a lighter option and enjoyed some Burrata and Beets at Larry's Bar &amp; Grill.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/6dynwvyb7q9fon9luvmogmd3wbei2szk.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The most adventurous meal was at dinner with a friend at Wurstküche. We enjoyed some cold beers and Rattlesnake Sausages. It honestly didn't taste much different from other sausages and was actually pretty good but I can't say I'd comfortably eat that again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/aypjyy5024v7hcfqhqa4dwl3x6injkm7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The weekend was filled with new musical obsessions, including Zhu &amp; Flume (seriously check out that playlist ^), new friends, delicious eats, and lots and lots of dust. We danced our asses off to Zedd and Calvin Harris, reveled in the unfair flawlessness that is Ellie Goulding, and sang our hearts out with Akon, Sean Paul, and Nico&amp;Vinz during Matoma's set.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/duq94s8q18b3qklwj730gkuu2l5szcpm.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ie4gkxnr4yruv5grnjyaya1iunyoj6pm.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I came back home the following Monday sunburned (what happens when you wander around LA without sunscreen) and exhausted out of my mind; Cue sickness.</p>\n<p>This was my first year attending Coachella, every instagrammer's and basic bitch's haven. Of course I had to have ONE basic picture myself to commemorate the experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/z7gfp3dlql2f2wag911y4lvsznp2q06v.jpg\" alt=\"insert basic watermelon picture here\"></p>\n<p>Coachella is also a GREAT place for foodies. While you needed to be a VIP to get access to some of the tastiest and more exclusive food, there was plenty of delicious options to spare. Looking back at my food photos, I realize that I basically survived off fries. Just fries. And obviously watermelon, because it IS Coachella. But these fries were no ordinary fries my friends. They were all loaded with various toppings and delicious goodness.</p>\n<p>Veggie Monster Fries with lots of types of slaw and jalapeños!<br>\n<img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/z4ge00bngygbfezcdyv3x4gdsve5p72u.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Vegetarian Poutin Fries with cheese curds!<br>\n<img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/uyr9jkumf8n2a6mzue6bxdrimbfblro2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Crab Fries!

It is a small cuban street food restaurant in downtown Ann Arbor. While it may be a slight walk from the University of Michigan campus, many students make the trek despite any ridiculous weather conditions to get a bite of these burgers.</p>\n<p>They have the one of the most delicious, insanely huge and jam packed burgers I’ve ever eaten in my life. No matter the patty you want inside your burger, whether it be black bean, chicken, or chorizo, you’re bound to get a tasty concoction which will blow your mind. Honestly I have yet to meet a person at the University of Michigan who doesn’t like their burgers.</p>\n<p>The basic burger (or Frita) is simple, just the patty between two egg buns and stuffed with fries. I also added some cilantro-lime salsa and tropical slaw to juice it up a little. Safe to say, I don’t think I would be trying to impress anyone while eating this monstrosity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7598/16243253993_f6b6d7018a_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>My brother always goes with a sunny side up egg and avocado spread on his frita.

She decided to go big or go home and made her frita “loco.” This means that they just go “loco” and add ALL of their available toppings on top of your burger: muenster, a sunny side up egg, cilantro lime salsa, tropical slaw, AND avocado spread! This is pretty much the mother of all burgers. I mean its GINORMOUS. My friend wasn’t even able to attempt to eat this with her hands. But oh was it delicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8669/16240858444_1a3f8e5341_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Don’t get me started on their garlic-cilantro fries.

We had spagetti squash, acorn squash and some other types I honestly have no idea what they are called.</p>\n<p>Originally they had all just been sliced in half and used as decorative bowl for a lunch party my mom threw. But unfortunately, that resulted in tons and tons of leftover squash. I decided to attempt to make use of them.</p>\n<p>First, I made an &quot;alfredo&quot; penne pasta. Here's the recipe for reference. I did make a few adjustments partially on accident; I apparently used a different kind of similar tasting squash instead of acorn squash (pictured below), I used normal milk instead of plant milk and a little mozzerella cheese instead of yeast flakes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5613/15216086813_bef71f0970_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <span class=\"item\">\n      <h2 class=\"fn\"><a href=\"http://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2010/10/acorn-squash-vegan-alfredo-sauce-kamut.html\">Acorn Alfredo Pasta</a></h2>\n    </span>\n    <div class=\"summary\" style=\"clear:left\">\n      <p><em>Recipe by http://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2010/10/acorn-squash-vegan-alfredo-sauce-kamut.html</em></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\"><h4>Acorn Alfredo Sauce</h4>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">4 Cups roasted Acorn Squash (about 1 medium squash)</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup fresh basil</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">3/4 cup milk</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1/3 cup mozzarella cheese</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">2-3 Tbsp EVOO</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">2-3 Tbsp Dijon Mustard</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">2-3 Tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">2 Tbsp roasted garlic</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">2 Tbsp dried Italian herbs (basil, oregano, thyme)</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 Tbsp maple syrup</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp red pepper flakes or dash of cayenne</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">salt and pepper</li>\n        <br>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 bag pasta</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">2-3 cups mushrooms</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Turn on oven to 350 degrees.</p>\n        <p>Fill a casserole dish with an inch of water.

Remove all skin and place squash flesh in a food processor. Add all other ingredients.</p>\n        <p>Blend on high for at least 2 minutes. You want all the parsley to chop into fine bits. Set sauce aside.</p>\n        <p>Boil a pot of salted water. Cook your pasta. 2-3 minutes before the pasta is ready to drain, add mushrooms and optional protein add-in's. Drain as usual.

It wasn't bad, but personally I'd rather just eat a smaller portion of normal alfredo rather than fabricating the same kind of taste with squash.</p>\n<p>When my mom came home and informed me I had used the wrong squash to make my pasta, we decided to actually make use of the REAL acorn squash! We kept it simple, just seasoning slice and roasting them as &quot;fries&quot;. This in comparison was amazing. It was very similar to sweet potato fries. We loved it so much we actually ate most of them before even thinking of taking a photo! :)</p>\n<p>The final remaining squash we had left was spaghetti squash. Initially, we were confused on what it had to do with spaghetti at all, but once we stuck it in the oven for a while with a little oil, it finally made sense. After roasting the squash, it looks just like spaghetti! Doesn't quite taste the same, but could work as a substitute.</p>\n<p>This time we decided to make pizza using the squash to make the crust. The most important thing to keep in mind when using spaghetti squash to make pizza crust is to really squeeze ALL of the moisture out of it before putting it in the oven. The less moisture when cooking, the crispier and less flimsy the pizza crust! We used <a href=\"http://sharedappetite.com/recipes/gluten-free-spaghetti-squash-pizza-crust/\">this recipe</a> by <a href=\"http://sharedappetite.com\">Shared Appetite</a>. We covered 1/2 of the pizza with pesto sauce (hence the insane amount of oil in the picture) and 1/2 with marinara sauce, tossed a few mushroom slices, covered it with cheese and then baked the &quot;pizza&quot;.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5605/15835512375_d6fc39deb4_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In all honesty, I realize I'm not a HUGE squash fan. My parents didn't hate the pasta or the pizza. It just didn't feel the same. I'd personally rather indulge in smaller portions in the real thing rather than trying to replicate the same experience with other ingredients. However, I would definitely recommend that you try acorn squash fries! Those were amazing :)</p>\n","feature_image":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5613/15216086813_bef71f0970_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22e","name":"squash","slug":"squash"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22f","name":"pasta","slug":"pasta"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c230","name":"pizza","slug":"pizza"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c231","name":"acorn","slug":"acorn"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c232","name":"spaghetti","slug":"spaghetti"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c233","name":"fries","slug":"fries"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fries","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
