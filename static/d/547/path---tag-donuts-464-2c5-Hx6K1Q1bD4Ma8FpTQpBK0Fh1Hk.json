Anytime anyone sees their local Girl Scouts at the grocery store, they start drooling and daydreaming of Thin Mints, Tagalongs, Samoa's, and Do-si-Dos. Girl Scout cookies are some of my favorite type of cookies in the world. While I may mainly be a fan of the plain shortbread cookies, Trefoils. Thin mints and Samoa's are America's two favorites.</p>\n<p>While plunging into the depths of Pinterest one day, I found a recipe for mini samoa donuts. That got me thinking... What if I were to make mini girl scout themed cupcakes. And to make them even better, give them a slight &quot;adult&quot; twist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LVZHqaB-oL-fVWQXFOi2BHG5JYGj8Y-hcensdE9O9mSA=w1312-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Not to toot my own horn, but these donut bites were <em>AMAZING</em>. Although they were <em>really</em> donuts... but rather cupcakes. They still tasted great. There was definitely not enough alcohol in any of the desserts to do any damage but the slight bourbon taste in the caramel brought out some awesome flavors.</p>\n<p>My cousins and I even had a hard time not finishing up the caramel bourbon sauce before the donuts were ready. We kept eating spoon by spoon of the creamy booze-ness.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Drizzle some warm caramel bourbon sauce onto a scoop of ice cream... HEAVEN.</p>\n<p>When I took these desserts to work, they were gone within minutes. Clearly everyone else was dying to get their Girl Scout cookie fix like I was. I even saw this guy spooning caramel bourbon sauce into his coffee to make it a little more &quot;Irish.&quot; ;)</p>\n<p>Here are the recipes for the donut bites. Even if you don't make the bites themselves... you DEFINITELY have to try the Caramel Bourbon sauce. It takes a few minutes to make and is EXTREMELY rewarding.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BYvxNbTPOJb518dtM6jLTZ9gwTDpQpmuj15u6oPPormA=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pk7bQdao45MiJPXztLw3P1jt6yLFAw5g-mIGogM4G2O5=w1458-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Samoa Donut Bites</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <h4>Donuts:</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ tsp baking powder</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ cup milk</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ tbsp lemon juice</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp butter, melted</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">4 tbsp Southern Comfort Caramel</li>\n      <h4>Caramel Bourbon Sauce</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 package melting caramel (about 14 oz)</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">3 tbsp milk</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp Souther Comfort Caramel</li>\n<pre><code>  &lt;h4&gt;Toppings&lt;/h4&gt;\n  &lt;li class=&quot;ingredient&quot;&gt;3 cups unsweetened coconut flakes, toasted&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;h3 id=&quot;directions&quot;&gt;Directions:&lt;/h3&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Cronut Fever. A chef in New York City decided that he would take croissant dough and fry it like a donut. This scrumptious flaky dessert became <strong>SO</strong> popular that there was even a black market for them! People would pay $100 on the black market for a cronut that could be bought for $5 if they waited in line for a day.</p>\n<p>I'd never tasted a cronut before in my life, so I decided to make use of a bunch of stale croissants I had lying around after a road trip. I tore the croissants into bite size pieces and fried them in hot oil and count to 4. Quickly flip each cronut and fry again for 4 counts. Make sure not to cook them for too long or they get a little too crunchy and burn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uItKVRYVHXTTy-8axm084k_HfxLO6xzEZdPLVsRCD4KB=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Place the fried bites onto paper towels to drain any excess oil. When cooled, drizzle with any icing of your choice or enjoy them by themselves!</p>\n<p>They were flaky yet crunchy, salty yet buttery. It was amazing! I completely understand what the fuss was in New York City at the time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t7G8JSAQTWhF4tYo7phZ4pW0JmJUR3wW9tfbTtKWJiYd=s800\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jSVFKsebGkxhYqNYuiNsVIhtieIrE3c0NZTu-IJJw5VK=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>However, I learned a few things while making these. Making them with store-bought croissants is fine, however you get the proper ratio of flakiness to fried crunchiness when you use croissant dough. It is also easier not to burn them while frying when you use dough. I am not a huge fan of too much oil, so frying the croissants wasn't my favorite. Maybe there's a way to shallow fry them where they won't pick up too much oil, but I have no idea. Next time I try making cronut bites, I will try to bake store-bought croissants and see if that makes a difference. Who knows!</p>\n<p>For the mean time, I completely suggest you try making these at home! They're simple to make and taste amazing! If you're too lazy then I'd recommend going to your local pastry shop and seeing if they make something similar!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_h3gaGiFbUHaUe_a9dnjOu6yMLoZv8oXEt19I2f1god5=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I3bLdLcbLHBZH2QIeDqAX55etYu-5I1Tz94-7LJ62KRW=s800","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23d","name":"brunch","slug":"brunch"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23f","name":"breakfast","slug":"breakfast"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c27d","name":"donuts","slug":"donuts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c283","name":"cronut","slug":"cronut"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c284","name":"fried","slug":"fried"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c285","name":"croissant","slug":"croissant"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"donuts","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
