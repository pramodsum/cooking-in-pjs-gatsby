Well now you do so you're welcome.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:57FvuUotRyzRl8hwIhCVuO\" width=\"auto\" max-width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>In case you weren't aware... Jimmy Buffett actually had a cameo in Jurassic World last year. Of course he was one of the people escaping the pterodactyls. But of course, in true Margaritaville fashion, he makes sure to grab BOTH of his margaritas before making a run for it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rHfvEne.gif?noredirect\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This man is a hero. He clearly knows what today is about. If you haven't already, definitely play the song I linked to above while reading the post. I promise the lyrics won't disappoint. If you're really digging the song, I totally recommend checking out the entire album. It's a gold mine of amazing songs like &quot;Cheeseburger in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Pencil Thin Mustache&quot;, &quot;Grapefruit - Juicy Fruit&quot;, &quot;Son of a Son of a Sailor&quot;, and last but not least &quot;Why Don't We Get Drunk.&quot; I've linked the entire album here for your enjoyment. Do it. I promise it's totally worth it.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:6MlglzxBetAjx7yZNAQt3D\" width=\"auto\" max-width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>Using the great Jimmy Buffett and National Margarita Day as inspiration, I figured I can FINALLY share the amazing strawberry margaritas with you guys. I made these margaritas last year for a Cinco de Mayo celebration at my cousin's place. Technically it was Seis de Mayo because May 5th last year was a Tuesday and everyone was busy that day. These were a HUGE hit and best part is that when you run out of strawberries you can just use more lime juice and make plain margaritas. It's the best.</p>\n<p>In case you needed more convincing to actually listen to that song:</p>\n<p><em>&quot;But there's booze in the blender, and soon it will render that frozen concoction that helps me hang on.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Yeah... I know. He sings from the heart. Now turn on the song and start blending up some delicious margaritas for you and your friends!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/3vs3q24ymcfuxdqkfsiuu3m7y0k1itr7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Frozen Strawberry Margaritas</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Just as a warning, these are quite strong so I'd recommend tasting as you add the tequila.
