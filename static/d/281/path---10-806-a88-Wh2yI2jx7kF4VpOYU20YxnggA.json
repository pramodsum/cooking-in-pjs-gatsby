We had spagetti squash, acorn squash and some other types I honestly have no idea what they are called.</p>\n<p>Originally they had all just been sliced in half and used as decorative bowl for a lunch party my mom threw. But unfortunately, that resulted in tons and tons of leftover squash. I decided to attempt to make use of them.</p>\n<p>First, I made an &quot;alfredo&quot; penne pasta. Here's the recipe for reference. I did make a few adjustments partially on accident; I apparently used a different kind of similar tasting squash instead of acorn squash (pictured below), I used normal milk instead of plant milk and a little mozzerella cheese instead of yeast flakes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5613/15216086813_bef71f0970_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <span class=\"item\">\n      <h2 class=\"fn\"><a href=\"http://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2010/10/acorn-squash-vegan-alfredo-sauce-kamut.html\">Acorn Alfredo Pasta</a></h2>\n    </span>\n    <div class=\"summary\" style=\"clear:left\">\n      <p><em>Recipe by http://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2010/10/acorn-squash-vegan-alfredo-sauce-kamut.html</em></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\"><h4>Acorn Alfredo Sauce</h4>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">4 Cups roasted Acorn Squash (about 1 medium squash)</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup fresh basil</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">3/4 cup milk</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1/3 cup mozzarella cheese</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">2-3 Tbsp EVOO</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">2-3 Tbsp Dijon Mustard</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">2-3 Tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">2 Tbsp roasted garlic</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">2 Tbsp dried Italian herbs (basil, oregano, thyme)</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 Tbsp maple syrup</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp red pepper flakes or dash of cayenne</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">salt and pepper</li>\n        <br>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 bag pasta</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">2-3 cups mushrooms</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Turn on oven to 350 degrees.</p>\n        <p>Fill a casserole dish with an inch of water.

It wasn't bad, but personally I'd rather just eat a smaller portion of normal alfredo rather than fabricating the same kind of taste with squash.</p>\n<p>When my mom came home and informed me I had used the wrong squash to make my pasta, we decided to actually make use of the REAL acorn squash! We kept it simple, just seasoning slice and roasting them as &quot;fries&quot;. This in comparison was amazing. It was very similar to sweet potato fries. We loved it so much we actually ate most of them before even thinking of taking a photo! :)</p>\n<p>The final remaining squash we had left was spaghetti squash. Initially, we were confused on what it had to do with spaghetti at all, but once we stuck it in the oven for a while with a little oil, it finally made sense. After roasting the squash, it looks just like spaghetti! Doesn't quite taste the same, but could work as a substitute.</p>\n<p>This time we decided to make pizza using the squash to make the crust. The most important thing to keep in mind when using spaghetti squash to make pizza crust is to really squeeze ALL of the moisture out of it before putting it in the oven. The less moisture when cooking, the crispier and less flimsy the pizza crust! We used <a href=\"http://sharedappetite.com/recipes/gluten-free-spaghetti-squash-pizza-crust/\">this recipe</a> by <a href=\"http://sharedappetite.com\">Shared Appetite</a>. We covered 1/2 of the pizza with pesto sauce (hence the insane amount of oil in the picture) and 1/2 with marinara sauce, tossed a few mushroom slices, covered it with cheese and then baked the &quot;pizza&quot;.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5605/15835512375_d6fc39deb4_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In all honesty, I realize I'm not a HUGE squash fan. My parents didn't hate the pasta or the pizza. It just didn't feel the same. I'd personally rather indulge in smaller portions in the real thing rather than trying to replicate the same experience with other ingredients. However, I would definitely recommend that you try acorn squash fries! Those were amazing :)</p>\n","feature_image":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5613/15216086813_bef71f0970_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22e","name":"squash","slug":"squash"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22f","name":"pasta","slug":"pasta"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c230","name":"pizza","slug":"pizza"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c231","name":"acorn","slug":"acorn"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c232","name":"spaghetti","slug":"spaghetti"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c233","name":"fries","slug":"fries"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c33f","uuid":"a5188542-9fe4-4445-8e55-9ffc5a39a59e","title":"The Perfect Fall Soup","slug":"the-perfect-fall-soup","published_at":"27 October, 2014","html":"<p>As leaves turn crunchy on sidewalks and the wind blows colder, I (Anu) get a craving for soup. It’s part of fall. I don’t go for pumpkin everything, but as soon as fall starts, I pull out boots, sweaters, and the ingredients for soup. The thing is, Sumu won’t drink soup unless it’s pho, whereas I will drink any soup you put before me, so this was a bit of a solo adventure.</p> <p>I made this soup while bugging Sumu with text after text regarding my soup adventure. She continued to inform me that she didn’t like soup (which I’ve actually known for quite a while now) and I continued bothering her with descriptions of roasting vegetables and the warm veggie-y soup-y smells coming from my oven.</p> <p>I’m not going to lie to you; this is a simple soup, but it takes a few hours to prepare. There’s the cutting and arranging, the sprinkling and drizzling, the lovely roasting, the blending, and the simmering. But this is mostly passive cooking, and in the end, you get this gorgeous orangey-red soup which is made entirely with whole heart-healthy foods. It’s old fashioned, it’s got a bit of a bite from the pepper and the chilies, and it tastes great with toast and olive oil, with a dash of cilantro for garnish.</p> <img src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10646631_10152805354384948_4396991600090346254_n.jpg?oh=5ea9ea6a4456c0d1e8870e4603b198cd&oe=54F39937&__gda__=1424994888_113f0fb9fe640a63cb45a0acf3409d71\" alt=\"...\" class=\"img-rounded\"> <p>This is the perfect fall soup; it mimics the lovely turning of the leaves outside, and puts you in the mind for roaring fires, thick nubby socks, and crusty brown bread.</p> <ul class=\"list-unstyled\"> Ingredients: <li> Three red bell peppers</li> <li> Chili peppers (to taste) </li> <li> Two carrots</li> <li> Two medium-sized onions</li> <li> Half a sweet potato</li> <li> Ten Roma tomatoes (approx. three lbs) </li> <li> Black Pepper (to taste) </li> <li> Two tbsp. olive oil</li> <li> Salt (to taste) </li> <li> Chili powder (to taste) </li> <li> One tbsp dry basil </li> <li> One half cup cashews </li> </ul> <p>So to be totally honest, I made this recipe up as I went along. I knew I wanted a spicy soup with tons of roasted tomatoes, and I just decided to add other vegetables as I went along. So, if you don’t like any of the stuff mentioned above, just swap it out for something you do like. I’m sure many varieties of squash would taste amazing in this soup, and if you’re a pumpkin everything sorta fall person, just roast that along with everything else! I am also a gal who LOVES her chilies. I love spicy food. I cannot overstress this point, and that was the biggest reason I added cracked pepper, chili powder, and raw chilies with a liberal hand. If you are less in love with fiery food, by all means use only one or two of these things (if you take one thing out, take out the chili powder) and simple adjust to your family’s taste. Keep in mind that we’ll be adding water at the final stage, so the spice and veggies will be diluted just a bit.</p> <p>Now, to the actual recipe!</p> <p>Before you do anything, soak those cashews in water – just set them in a bowl so they’re just covered and cover the bowl with a plate or something. Let sit undisturbed until ready for use. Next, set your oven to preheat to 350 degrees.</p> <p>Now, get your veggies out and cut and arrange them onto baking trays. I left my bell peppers whole and stuffed my chilies inside to ensure that the chilies wouldn’t burn. I cut my onions into quarters, my carrots in half, my sweet potato into thick medallions, and all my tomatoes in half. Depending on the size of your veggies you may choose to go bigger or smaller – it’s really up to you – just make sure that many of your veggies are close in size to one another, so that they cook at approximately similar rates. Over the top of your veggies, sprinkle olive oil, salt, basil, cracked pepper, and chili powder. If you like other spices and wanted to add those as well/instead, go ahead! This is YOUR SOUP – feel the cooking genius in you come alive as you play with flavor combinations.</p> <img src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/10334397_10152805354194948_1460243871049300878_n.jpg?oh=1c9c00185e0d033571d42f20fa2dcbf6&oe=54F4E311&__gda__=1420867694_9534804f0469612f183497cdbd9316bf\" alt=\"...\" class=\"img-rounded\"> <img src=\"https://scontent-a-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/1800457_10152805354224948_7008550352881876254_n.jpg?oh=8e49857fb586a865b095d6e4a5ccb4a7&oe=54F1E9DB\" alt=\"...\" class=\"img-rounded\"> <p>Slide your baking trays into the oven, and settle in for the hardest part; the waiting. Your veggies will roast for over an hour – mine took right around an hour and fifteen minutes. You want to roast until your bell peppers are all but collapsed, your onions and tomatoes are shriveling (the tomato more so than the onion), and your sweet potatoes and carrots are soft to the touch. For many of you, it is likely possible to get other work done while you wait. I’d wager that you have the will power required to be productive while your oven emanates smells and your kitchen comes alive.</p> <p>I myself turned on the oven light and parked myself right in front of it with a good book, looking up frequently to check on the veggies. To each their own.</p> <p>After your vegetables are done roasting, turn off your oven and let your baking trays remain inside until just cooled – about half an hour. You want the vegetables to be at a point where they’re still warm, but not so much so that you can’t handle them with your bare hands. Now, if you have an immersion blender, you can put all your veggies and the cashews you’ve been soaking into whatever pot you’ve set aside for soup and get to blending. I myself blended the veggies and cashews in batches in my blender (it took me three batches) before pouring all of it into a soup pot with about two cups of water to start.</p><p> </p><p>I stirred and added water until I was pleased with the consistency, then covered it and let it simmer. I stirred about every ten minutes to fully combine the water and the veggies, and made last minute adjustments to taste at this stage. Finally, after about a half hour of chopping, an hour and fifteen of roasting, a half hour of cooling, and another half hour of blending and simmering, it was ready. I opted for traditional grilled cheese, and garnished with a drizzle of olive oil and some cilantro, and welcomed fall in the best and yummiest way possible.</p> <img src=\"https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-9/1779301_10152805354474948_3215454825882605939_n.jpg?oh=0811d19279668ad0b9e0437d5ee1fa8e&oe=54C03A64\" alt=\"...\" class=\"img-rounded\">","feature_image":null,"tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22b","name":"soup","slug":"soup"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22c","name":"fall","slug":"fall"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22d","name":"tomato","slug":"tomato"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c343","uuid":"c162695b-24a0-403b-9e68-876c1f48541d","title":"Sushi Go-Round","slug":"sushi-go-round","published_at":"14 October, 2014","html":"<p><img src=\"https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/n31.0-8/1941326_10152901018779384_657077737554217091_o.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive img-rounded\"> </p><p> When we were little, we didn’t totally get along a hundred percent of the time. And when we did, we were usually playing on my original Nintendo 64. I only had two games that really interested us – a Winnie the Pooh game and Pokémon Stadium, and we were obsessed with the mini-games on Pokémon Stadium; we used to play them over and over, trying our best to beat the other out. One of the games featured a bunch of Lickatungs swiping sushi off of a rotating table with their gigantic and hilariously gross tongues. At the time, neither of us had eaten sushi, and we used to talk about what it would taste like, and whether or not we ourselves could make it. Now, roughly ten years after last playing that game (we held on long after most others had let go) we finally made sushi! And while we didn’t go around swiping it up with our tongues, we were definitely tempted. </p> <p> <img src=\"http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmskfdm1ix1qjhv5fo1_500.gif\" class=\"img-responsive img-rounded\"> </p> <p> The entire process was far easier than we expected, and since we made it at home, we got to mess around a little with our fillings! We just julienned some of the vegetables we liked and we were ready to mix and match to our heart’s content. </p> <img src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t31.0-8/p960x960/10658701_10152901008199384_7718840313015664375_o.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive img-rounded\"> <h5>Vegetables:</h5> <li>Cucumber </li> <li>Carrot </li> <li>Avocado</li> <li>Asparagus </li> <li>Sweet Potato </li> <li>Mushrooms</li> <li>Nori (roasted seaweed – if you have a preferred brand/type, go with it!) </li> <p> Obviously, if you don’t like any of these vegetables but do like others, feel free to use those instead! We were planning to use red peppers, and then realized we didn’t have any, so we just did without them – it’s really no big deal, especially if you’re just cooking for yourself. </p> <img src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/n31.0-8/10700488_10152901010409384_2241969642949565027_o.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive img-rounded\"> <h5>Condiments/Toppings:</h5> <li>Spicy Mayo (we made our own with Sriracha and Mayonnaise) </li> <li>Wasabi Sauce </li> <li>Soy Sauce </li> <h5>Rice:</h5> <li>Rice Wine Vinegar </li> <li>Sugar </li> <li>Long grain white rice (we used basmati, and it was fine!)</li> <p> The amount of rice you want to make is directly proportional to the amount of sushi you want to produce; we used about three cups of rice (when uncooked) to make about twelve rolls of sushi. If you’re cooking for two to four people, two cups of rice will be more than enough. </p> <img src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/n31.0-8/10708750_10152901009409384_1003557599801581375_o.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive img-rounded\"> <p> We got a head start with rice we had left over from the day before – rather than making rice again, we just added rice wine vinegar and sugar to it before heating it up, and then chilling it. If you have to make rice, though, you can do so either in a pan on the stove or in a rice cooker. In a rice cooker, put in a 1:2 ratio of rice to water, and let sit for three “screams” of the cooker. If you’re making it in a saucepan, just use similar ratios, stir at the beginning, and then leave it alone for about twenty minutes. Once it’s fully cooked, take it off the stove and mix in the sugar and vinegar fully – let it chill for a little while (we stuck it in the freezer to speed that up a bit). </p> <p> While your rice is chilling, cut your vegetables into long, thin strips – the thinner your strips, the easier it will be to fit multiple fillings in one sushi roll, and the easier time you’ll have rolling it at the end. </p> <p> Now it’s time to mix your spicy mayo. The making of spicy mayo is largely to taste – we used about one tablespoon of mayo to one teaspoon of sriracha, but you can adjust with more or less sriracha depending on how spicy you like your food. </p> <p> Finally, after all this prep, it’s time to get rolling! Set out a towel, set your bamboo mat on top of it, and put a sheet of cling wrap on top of that. If you don’t have a bamboo mat, just set your cling wrap on top of your towel. While it might be a bit more difficult for you to get the perfect roll, it can certainly done. </p> <p> Now, set your nori sheet on top of the cling wrap, spread a thin layer of rice over it, and your vegetables at one end on top of your rice. Starting at the end with the vegetables, start rolling the nori carefully so that your veggies are at the middle of your roll, making sure the roll is as tight as possible without ripping the seaweed. You want to have a compact roll with veggies nestled at the very center. </p> <img src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/t31.0-8/p960x960/10697276_10152901014009384_5264652996330153076_o.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive img-rounded\"> <p> Rolling is a trial and error activity; my first rolls were far from pretty (in fact, we had to eat the piles of rice and seaweed with spoons!) but by the fourth or fifth roll, I pretty much had the hang of it. </p> <p> Once you’re done rolling your sushi, cut it up into slices about ¾ of an inch thick, and set them on a plate. Set all your condiments out, and get ready to enjoy your delicious hand-made sushi. </p> <img src=\"https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/t31.0-8/p960x960/10668861_10152901012799384_7205083838892774006_o.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive img-rounded\"> <p> Bring on the noms! </p> <img src=\"https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/t31.0-8/p960x960/10704329_10152901018089384_4510287944786121987_o.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive img-rounded\"><p></p>\n","feature_image":"https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/n31.0-8/1941326_10152901018779384_657077737554217091_o.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22a","name":"sushi","slug":"sushi"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c344","uuid":"387e6233-162d-4a84-b5f3-7808f02e256c","title":"first post. much excitement. wow","slug":"first-post-much-excitement-wow","published_at":"08 October, 2014","html":"<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Fg91yh0.jpg\" class=\"img-responsive img-rounded\">","feature_image":"http://i.imgur.com/Fg91yh0.jpg","tags":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":6,"skip":54,"numPages":10,"currentPage":10}}
