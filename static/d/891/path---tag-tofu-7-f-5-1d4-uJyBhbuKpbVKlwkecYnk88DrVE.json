I've thrown all sorts of information in there and\ngiven it a good shake, and things are tumbling about pretty wildly right now.\n\nExam season is upon me, and I am not bearing up well under the stress. Just\ndon't ask me how many hot Cheetos I've consumed, because that could get super\nembarrassing super fast. My food consumption these days in 50% leftovers, 30%\neggs, 10% random free food, and 10% cheese, so you could say things are a bit\nmad right now.\n\nI'm so excited to finish the semester and start cooking again. In the meantime\nthough, I want to leave this recipe I made a bit ago here.\n\n\n\nI'd never made tofu scramble before, so there was quite a bit of googling\ninvolved. In the end, I came up with a recipe that hit all the right spots, and\nwas healthy to boot! I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys savory\nbreakfast, even the pledged carnivores; this tofu is delicious!\n\nTofu Scramble\nThere are two keys to making this a good recipe: (1) extremely firm tofu - the\nfirmest you can locate at the store, and (2) marinate it over night.\n\nYield: 2 servings\n\nTotal Time:  30 minutes\n\nIngredients:\nMarinade\n2 Tbsp Soy Sauce\n 2 Tbsp C Vinegar4 Tbsp Nutritional Year1 Tsp Garlic Powder1 Tsp Onion Powder\n Scramble\n1 Package Extremely Firm Tofu\n Handful of BroccoliHandful of Kale5-6 Mushrooms\n Directions:\n\n1.) Mix your marinade ingredients together, and add water if you need to so that\nit's not too thick. It should be roughly the consistency of gravy.\n\n  \n2.) Rip your tofu into bit sized chunks with forks or with your hands, and mix\nthe marinade into the tofu. Set the mixture in the fridge overnight.\n\n  \n3.) Chop your broccoli, kale, and mushrooms, and cook your veg - broccoli, then\nkale and mushrooms together. Be sure to add some salt and spices to the\nvegetables!\n\n  \n4.) When the vegetables are half cooked, create a space, and pour your tofu\nscramble in. Let it cook for a few minutes, 5-7 should be just enough.\n\n  \n5.) Pour into a bowl with some hashbrowns and enjoy!    </p>\n  </div>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/tj5saknljx5vewphutanvgu2he6w75gg.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c318","name":"tofu","slug":"tofu"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23f","name":"breakfast","slug":"breakfast"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23d","name":"brunch","slug":"brunch"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c313","name":"savory","slug":"savory"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c319","name":"scramble","slug":"scramble"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31a","name":"noms","slug":"noms"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c378","uuid":"4f6c5f80-e95b-43b4-882b-0df100605e8e","title":"New City, New Beginnings","slug":"new-city-new-beginnings","published_at":"14 April, 2016","plaintext":"So things have been a bit crazy for me over the last few weeks. I made my first\nsolo move as an adult. I packed up my apartment in Sunnyvale and finally  moved\nto San Francisco. If you're wondering why I picked this specific Van Morrison\nsong, I felt like it was meant to be. The song Saint Dominic's Preview has a lot\nof references to the Saint Dominic's Church on the intersection of Bush and\nSteiner in San Francisco, literally a block from my new apartment. Everyday when\nI walk back from the bus stop after work, I pass by this gorgeous church and\nadmire it. It just felt right to pick this song for the post. :)\n\nHowever, if that song isn't your speed and you want something a little more\nsultry, try this one by Carmen McRae.\n\nI've had a blast since moving out here. I get to see my friends almost every\nday. I have a wonderful new roommate who I've known since college. Even after\nonly a week, I've got to attend all sorts of weird and yet awesome things! This\nwas an art exhibit that was installed right outside City Hall over this past\nweek.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd best of all, I get to cook with my friends, both old and new! I went over to\na friend's place yesterday night and me and a new friend, Kerry, began to make\nsome DELICIOUS fresh spring rolls. Granted, the recipe for this has been posted\non this site before, the food could never have been more delicious and\ndifferent. We filled these with lettuce, shrimp, vermicelli noodles, and more!\nWe even made some peanut sauce to dip the rolls in (just mix some hoisin sauce\nand creamy peanut butter together). Simple, yet delicious!\n\nWe did have some mishaps during the process. San Francisco kitchens are usually\nTINY, as are a lot of the apartments. My friend's kitchen is very much sizable\nfor 1 person cooking. When you try to squeeze 4 people in there, chaos ensues.\n\n 1. We were lied to about the presence of peanut butter, hence sending the boys\n    on one trip to the store\n 2. Kerry and I weren't aware that the pasta strainer LOCKED onto the pot we\n    were cooking the noodles in. This unfortunately caused ALL of the noodles to\n    fall into the sink, hence a second trip to the store to get more noodles\n 3. The boys may never let us live this down. Highly unlikely after all the sass\n    given while Kerry and I made their dinner.\n 4. They showed me this amazing group that performs acoustic covers of popular\n    songs [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y7Vq9749s8]... MIND BLOWING. I'm not\n    gonna lie I may have teared up a bit.\n\nWhile I may not have an explicit recipe for you, I have plenty of photos and\nfull stomachs as proof.
