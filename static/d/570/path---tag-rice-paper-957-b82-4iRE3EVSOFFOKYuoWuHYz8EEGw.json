Sorry for the brief and awkward hiatus; it was certainly not our intention, and won't be happening again! Sumu was moving, and I was letting law school rain on my parade. But we're back now!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/les6q1cfxgmpzlte37u7exyiu2zh8ciz.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Sumu's all settled into her new apartment in the city, and while law school is still kicking my ass, I've decided to chill out. Law school itself was never the point, and forgetting that is the number one cause of stress for me.</p>\n<p>So, we're kicking off our triumphant return with a throwback recipe. When I got to California to visit Sumu, we made fresh rolls. I'll be honest and say that I don't know the difference between a spring roll and a fresh roll. What I do know is that fresh rolls, full of bright, delicious veggies and sauces, feel like spring time to me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/phdkcdohsofvt6m9sa21vdx75ruyr006.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This recipe is easily customizable, for which reason there are no specific quantities in the recipe. Do what your heart tells you. Go with your gut. Feel out your local grocer and figure out what you can get in what quantities.</p>\n<p>Spring is finally here, and while spring break has long since passed, these rolls will pretty much always be in season.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3\" style=\"max-width: 640px !important; height: auto;\"><iframe src=\"https://app.box.com/embed/preview/dv94gc5megoxu2129ynqir8vees3f0tt?theme=dark\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" msallowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Spring Rolls</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>These are the best way to deliver a quick, one two punch of veggies to yo' bod.

Set a shallow plate full of hot water beside you, and take out a rice paper sheet. Dip it into the water for ten seconds, and then lay it out on a cutting board. \n</p>\n<p>\n3.) Layer your veggies and tofu in a mound in the middle of the sheet, then drizzle sauces over it. Fold the two sides over, then roll smoothly from top to bottom. \n</p>\n<p>\n4.) Enjoy.
