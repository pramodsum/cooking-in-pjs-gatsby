Despite his many divorces and nerdy dinosaur quirks, Dr. Gellar (no not that kind of doctor) was one of my favorite characters on Friends. Every time I make fajitas I remember Ross absolutely &quot;NOT&quot; being weird about Joey and Rachel starting to go out. One of the most classic Ross moments on the show.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.laughfrodisiac.com/uploads/1/8/5/4/18543868/6899821_orig.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I was in India when Netflix released all ten seasons of Friends.</p>\n<p><strong>ALL. TEN. SEASONS. EASILY. ACCESSIBLE. ON. THE. INTERNET.</strong></p>\n<p>This was huge. I can't even begin to count the endless number of illegally uploaded episodes I've watched on YouTube with Spanish subtitles. I ended up learning various inappropriate words through context. Made for some fun giggles during Spanish class.</p>\n<p>While I was searching a mood song for this post, I stumbled onto this gem.

So this January when I was in India, my cousin had major cravings for Mexican food. We decided to enhance our existing Galentine's Day plans from just <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/galentines-day-cupcakes/\">red velvet cupcakes</a> to include some simple yet delicious Mexican food.</p>\n<p>A lot of the parts of this recipe have already been posted in other posts, so I'm just going to link those rather than retyping. I just saut√©d a some spinach, bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms with my own <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/estoy-cantando/\">fajita seasoning</a> recipe. Added some corn salsa and <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/taco-tuesday/\">homemade sour cream</a> and <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/taco-tuesday/\">flour tortillas</a>. All you have left to do is roll it up and enjoy!</p>\n<p>Recipes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/estoy-cantando/\">fajita seasoning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/taco-tuesday/\">homemade sour cream &amp; flour tortillas</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8670/16426242248_05c7ff66f5_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8632/16613440465_f6ddd2bd12_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8683/16426430850_324b5f4a9f_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8628/16427647159_151d1d23ce_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/3chnt4gzvs3sg5exnvkiiy2q53zgqxfd.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c243","name":"mexican","slug":"mexican"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c245","name":"india","slug":"india"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c252","name":"fajitas","slug":"fajitas"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29c","name":"friends","slug":"friends"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29d","name":"ross","slug":"ross"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2aa","name":"family","slug":"family"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ross","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
