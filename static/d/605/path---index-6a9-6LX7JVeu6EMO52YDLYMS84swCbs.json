Listen while you\nread! :) And yes I know I know my title font doesn't handle tilde's very well...\nI'll fix that soon.\n\nSo at my office we have this concept of GSD; Get Shit Done.

This ALSO means I tend to bake or\ncook on Tuesdays because I have more time at home.\n\nThis week I decided to make Jalapeño Cheddar Beer Bread! 1) It's cheesy, spicy,\nand delicious and 2) Turns out beer can replace yeast in a lot of ways, except\nit does leave it's taste behind... so if that's not your thing just use yeast as\nyou would with normal bread.

This year\nwith all the ruckus that ever entertaining Donald Trump has caused, it only felt\nright to have her birthday be \"Make Anerica Great Again.\" PSA: Please do your\nresearch before this election season :)\n\nAlso... I HAD to include the video for this song because 1) Katrina Kaif looks\ngorgeous and 2) it's so damn catchy that it's become my new obsession.\n\nFor this birthday cake, I thought it'd be fun to embody one of a classic drink\nin the form of a cake.\n\nAn Old Fashioned Cake\n\n\nNot to toot my own horn, but I think this cake may have been the greatest one\nI've made so far. To be fair... I didn't make the actual cake from scratch. I\nhad initially and then had a few friends taste it because I was unsure. That\nbatch was probably the worst cakes I have ever made in my entire life.... There\nwas absolutely no way I could bring that to my friend's birthday celebration. At\nthat point, I was running short on time so I bought some standard Duncan Hines\nchocolate cake mixes and made 2 small round cakes according to package\ninstructions.\n\nHere's where the fun and experimentation started!\n\nAn old fashioned is a fairly simple drink according to Esquire Magazine\n[http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/recipes/a3880/old-fashioned-drink-recipe/]\n:\n1 Sugar Cube\n3 dashes of Angostura Bitters\n1 L Club Soda\n2 oz. Rye Whiskey\n\nSome people tend to garnish their drinks with orange peels and cherries to add\nsome flair to their drink. The hard core Don Drapers will stick to their stiff\ndrinks... but this is a cake so I had some fun with it.\n\nI decided there would be 3 components to this cake outside the base chocolate\ncake layers and the frosting on top.\n\n\n\nWhiskey Soaked Cherries\nThis is the easiest part of the entire cake. Just stick a bunch of cherries in a\njar and fill it with the whiskey/bourbon/etc of your choice. I used Jack Daniels\nfor everything in this cake because that's what we had at home. By the time\nyou're done with the rest of the cake, these cherries will be nice and boozy to\nstick on garnish the top!\n\nCandied Orange Peels\nThis part I wasn't really creative on. I followed the instructions in this\nrecipe\n[http://bakingthegoods.com/2013/12/06/drinking-buddies-recipe-whiskey-chocolate-cake-whisky-buttercream-frosting/]\n! It's actually fairly painless and you can do it while you're doing the rest of\nthe cake prep and ganache prep.\n\nNutella Whiskey Ganache Filling\nMy ganache filling ended up being a hodge podge of a few recipes I've both made\nbefore and found on the internets.\n\nNutella Whiskey Ganache\nIngredients:\n1 1/2 cup nutella\n 1 can sweetened condensed milk\n Whiskey to taste\n Confectioners sugar to thicken if needed\n Directions:\nCombine the ingredients on the stove on low heat until well mixed. Feel free to\nadd as much whiskey as you want based on how boozy you want the ganache to be.\nAllow the ganache to cool. If the ganache is still too thin, add some\nconfectioner's sugar until it thickens.\n\nAssembling this cake was pretty easy. Place a layer of cake on the plate and\npoke holes in it with the back of a wooden spoon. Pour ganache over until the\nholes are filled and a layer of ganache exists over the cake. Stack the other\nlayer of cake on top and also poke holes in this layer. Pour just enough ganache\nover this layer to fill the holes. Cover the cake with your favorite\nvanilla/plain frosting. I prefer Duncan Hines Cream Cheese frosting but that's\nup to you what kind of frosting you want! Top the cake with some whiskey\ncherries, candied orange peels, and even some chocolate or orange peel shavings\nif you want.\n\nEnjoy!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/qnuzhxf19zdc4qe7tz9qhjelervhkxc4.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c28b","name":"chocolate","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c8","name":"whiskey","slug":"whiskey"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c242","name":"giggle juice","slug":"giggle-juice"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c9","name":"birthday","slug":"birthday"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c337","name":"anerica","slug":"anerica"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c338","name":"old fashioned","slug":"old-fashioned"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c339","name":"orange","slug":"orange"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c33a","name":"cherry","slug":"cherry"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c36a","uuid":"a5004992-c2ed-4f4b-beac-59baa322db49","title":"Everyone needs a 'Lil Dicky' in their life","slug":"everyone-needs-a-lil-dicky-in-their-life","published_at":"19 July, 2016","plaintext":"So recently it was one of my closest friend's, whom we lovingly call Lil Dicky,\nbirthdays.
