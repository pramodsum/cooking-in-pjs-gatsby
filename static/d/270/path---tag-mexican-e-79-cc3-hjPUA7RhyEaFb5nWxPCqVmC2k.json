So when one of my friends was also bored at home during her spring break,\nshe decided to come over and join me in being a bum for a day. And what better\nfood to have while lazing around then some Mexican loaded fries.\n\n\n\nFeel free to use sour cream instead of ranch or even add guacamole and other\ntoppings you usually put on nachos! We didn't really want to leave the house and\ngo grocery shopping, so we went with whatever was in the fridge. I usually make\nmy own mexican seasoning, but feel free to replace the spices with a store\nbought seasoning if you want.\n\n\n\nMexican Loaded Fries\nThis is a very rough recipe. Feel free to throw in whatever you feel would taste\nbest!\n\nIngredients:\n½ bag of fries (I used crinkle cut)\n ranch (or sour cream)\n as much shredded cheese as you wantRefried Beans\n1 can black beans\n 1½ teaspoons cumin powder\n 1 teaspoon paprika\n salt to taste\n cayenne pepper to taste\n chili lime hot sauce to taste (optional)Pico De Gallo Salsa\n3 roma tomatoes diced\n ½ large onion diced\n juice of ½ a lime\n salt to taste\n few sprigs of cilantro Directions:\nRefried Beans:  Pour the black beans onto a skillet on the stove. Add all of the\nspices and keep stirring until the beans are soft and are super flavorful.\n\nSalsa:Mix all the ingredients in a bowl and let it sit so that the salt and lime\ncan bring out the flavor in the tomatoes.\n\nBake the fries according to the directions on the packet. When the fries are\ndone, don't turn off the oven. Top with the bean mixture and sprinkle all the\ncheese that your heart desires. Bake the topped fries in the oven until the\ncheese has melted. Take out the fries and top with salsa and ranch.

For example, McDonald's in India actually has\ncompletely vegetarian options. Due to the large  population of vegetarians in\nIndia, McDonald's has 2 segregated kitchens for vegetarian and non-vegetarian\nfood. In addition, they don't serve any beef items, in contrast to the\nMcDonald's in the US, which is primarily beef burgers. Honestly, I love\nMcDonald's in India! They've managed to merge Indian flavors into simple\nAmerican burgers and come out with amazing dishes such as the McSpicy Paneer and\nMcAloo Tiki Burger. If you haven't yet, you should definitely try the McSpicy\nPaneer Burger, it's my favorite! :)\n\n\n\nMy cousin recently had a major craving for Mexican food. The only problem is\nthat we're in India and the Mexican food available doesn't taste quite the same\nnor as authentic. In order to quench our cravings, we even tried going to Taco\nBell, which has a new item called the Paneer Tikka Masala Burrito! Unfortunately\nthe menu had been too Indianized and no longer tasted Mexican. While this style\nof Taco Bell is very popular with people in India, it doesn't quite measure up\nto the Taco Bell we have in the US.\n\n\n\nOur best bet was to figure out how to make it our selves. Unfortunately we did\nrun into a few bumps along the road:\n\n 1. It is a lot harder to find iceberg lettuce in Bangalore than originally\n    suspected. Iceberg lettuce isn't really in any kind of Indian food therefore\n    only available at some special markets rather than on every street vegetable\n    cart.\n\n\n\n 2. Many people tend to substitute dahi for sour cream out of convenience,\n    however, this doesn't have quite the same taste. Conveniently, we found a\n    fairly easy recipe\n    [http://www.tarladalal.com/Sour-Cream-(--Wraps-and-Rolls)-32623r]  on how to\n    make our own homemade sour cream! Tarla Dalal [http://www.tarladalal.com] \n    to the rescue!\n\n\n\n 3. Making the refried beans for the tacos ended up being extremely time\n    consuming. If I had been in the US, I could have just bought a can of beans,\n    cooked them with some cumin and cayene pepper and been done with it. I\n    completely took for granted the preparation needed to make refried beans.\n    First you needed to soak and cook the beans until they were soft, and then\n    cook them in a pan with the appropriate seasoning. This took much longer\n    than I had originally expected.\n\n\n\nWe realized even making tortillas by hand wouldn't be so bad. Every morning, the\ncook at my grandparents house makes chapatis from scratch. Tortillas are\nesentially chapatis made from normal flour, not wheat. So my grandmother quickly\nwhipped up a huge ball of dough for us to roll out and make into tortillas.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo taco would be complete without salsa! We made 2 different types of salsa,\ncorn with jalapenos and pico de gallo salsa. Both salsas are extremely easy to\nmake. For the corn salsa, you just need to combine boiled sweet corn kernels,\ndiced jalapenos, lemon juice, salt, and some cilantro. Mix it together and\nviola! You have salsa. Similarly, if you mix diced tomatoes and onions, minced\ngarlic, cilantro, and lemon juice you get pico de gallo salsa. Both can be made\nvery quickly and are fresh and delicious!\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly everything turned out really tasty and me and my cousin happily\nenjoyed delicious Mexican food for the next 2 days! :) My cousin loved it so\nmuch, she ate it for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner for the next 2 days. Mission\nSuccess!","feature_image":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7450/16401091685_d0ed039ea7_o.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c243","name":"mexican","slug":"mexican"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c244","name":"tacos","slug":"tacos"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c245","name":"india","slug":"india"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"mexican","limit":6,"skip":6,"numPages":2,"currentPage":2}}
