As of Friday, I am SORT OF on spring break. While I have an\nassignment due tomorrow that I am still working on, I've been in California\nvisiting Sumu since Friday!\n\nWhile I've buckled down a bit today, Sumu and I spent all of yesterday and this\nmorning running around San Francisco and nearby beaches.\n\nThe soundtrack to our trip?\n\nWe started off our day at Land's End Recreation Area, which was hands down my\nfavorite part of the trip so far. We parked, and it was about a mile walk to the\nbeach. The entire area was insanely picturesque, and I was half convinced that\nwe had stepped out of San Francisco and into a Lord of the Rings movie.\n\n\n\nFrom there, we went to get brunch, before heading to Valencia St. to look at\nstreet art, before heading to Dolores Park. On the way, we passed the The\nWomen's Building, which has one of the coolest murals I've ever seen on it - if\nyou find yourself in SF, definitely head over there. It's a celebration of\nwomen, and it's totally gorgeous.\n\n\n\nAfter that, we went to Dolores Park and visited the Golden Gate Bridge at\nsunset!\n\nToday, we woke up bright and early and headed to Capitola and Natural Bridges\nState Beach. We wandered around the beach for a while before getting ourselves\nto our favorite meal: brunch.\n\n\n\nThis place was pretty small, but really cute, and had excellent brunch options.\nI ordered Gallo Pinto, which was described on the menu as a Costa Rican dish.\n\n\n\nI liked my dish a lot; the plantains, rice, egg, and sauce went really well\ntogether, and I found myself clearing my plate!\n\nSumu got the Veggie Cocota, with was veggies and poached eggs covered in a\nCocota sauce. Research indicates that Cocota is a neighborhood in Brasil,\nalthough I can't speak to the authenticity of the sauce. Either way, it was\npretty good; the sauce is quite strong, and while I thought it was delicious, it\nwas a bit much for brunch.\n\n\n\nEither way, definitely worth a visit. If you're in Santa Cruz, definitely head\nover; they also have fresh juice that's perfect for taking with you to the\nbeach!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/hinrb93xbood40avb37ozvuldf5qqbtg.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c26c","name":"california","slug":"california"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f1","name":"besties","slug":"besties"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f2","name":"visits","slug":"visits"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f3","name":"spring break","slug":"spring-break"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f4","name":"santa cruz","slug":"santa-cruz"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f5","name":"san francisco","slug":"san-francisco"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f6","name":"land's end","slug":"lands-end"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f8","name":"natural bridges","slug":"natural-bridges"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f7","name":"the shire","slug":"the-shire"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f9","name":"golden gate","slug":"golden-gate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fa","name":"the women's center","slug":"the-womens-center"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fb","name":"cafe brasil","slug":"cafe-brasil"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"golden-gate","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
