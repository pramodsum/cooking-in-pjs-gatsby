If I had beaten the eggs longer to a more frothy froth, then the batter would have turned out more solid, WHICH in turn would have not allowed the batter to spill all over the baking sheet.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hQTnPY_5YThIn74VmP_f0T04hWsXL3elarQKE0Z_9JFn=w1080-h744-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>You can't blame me for not making perfect macarons...

It I guess technically was macarons but i wasn't able to get the perfect bubble shape. I was determined to perfect this recipe!</p>\n<p>THE MACARONS CANNOT WIN!</p>\n<p>So I set out to make batch 3. This time I let the egg whites &quot;age&quot; for a few days before using them. And I decided that I would try to be patient and actually wait for the meringue to be COMPLETELY done. I had gotten closer last time but not enough.</p>\n<p>What basically followed was me obsessively watching videos on how to make the perfect macarons. (I've provided some of those links here) My cousin literally thought I was insane because I watched videos for a good hour (okay maybe it was actually 2 hours... don't judge me).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://foodnouveau.com/destinations/europe/france/how-to-make-macarons-a-detailed-illustrated-step-by-step-recipe/\">http://foodnouveau.com/destinations/europe/france/how-to-make-macarons-a-detailed-illustrated-step-by-step-recipe/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foodiebaker.com/chocolate-macarons/\">http://www.foodiebaker.com/chocolate-macarons/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bri6xnDBl9I\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bri6xnDBl9I</a></p>\n<p>There are also TONS of other videos on youtube but let's be honest here... how many of you will actually be attempting to make these.

WAY too much effort in my opinion.</p>\n<p>However, they were quite tasty. Nicely crunchy yet light. We slathered some peanut butter and munched on a few macaron, or I guess in my case macaron-adjacents.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iOCibvCoZE8a1-lZfTuq58-efARuocQUpkjoBY3hg9Mj=w1996-h1498-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rqfEl9XDGtpP-gwzIITnumxEeg3G0Gc0CWxCdS8SpKSj=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>(Yes yes I know I spelled it wrong...
