While you are certainly welcome bring booze into the mix, these are instructions for figuring out an all food crawl; it's an excellent way to explore a new city!</p>\n<p>It's also a really good way to spend a couple of hours with friends without spending a ton of money; if you're on a budget, this is a great way to try lots of different food, and see quite a bit, without breaking the bank. We each paid for one entree at one place, and it came out perfectly for us!</p>\n<p>First, you need a walkable city. I myself did this with my friends Eden and Hafsa in San Francisco, the day I last left Sumu.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/nswhwh2moi2lyt9ett886237vfike5xh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Second, do some preliminary research. Don't actually choose all the places you want to go, but choose 1 or 2, or find a neighborhood that has a ton of stuff you're interested in exploring. We found ourselves wandering around the Mission District, ogling wall art and talking about gentrification.</p>\n<p>Third, set off on your journey! Start with a place you know you want to go to; we started with Philz Coffee, which also let us sip and wander for a bit before we found real food.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ifb3j8uif6p154mugitpvrh06kyjpziu.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Over the course of the next several hours, we tried Thai food, Mexican food, Vietnamese food, and, finally, Ethiopian food. At each place, we would choose one entree to share, so that in the end, we all got to try tons of yummy food for relatively little!</p>\n<p>We were having so much fun we failed to take a lot of pictures, but this is definitely one of those days that I'll be remembering for quite a while! If you do a food crawl, let me know how it goes!</p>\n<p>And, if you're in DC or San Francisco and you're interested in doing this, hit Sumu or I up! We'd love to have you :)</p>\n","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ifb3j8uif6p154mugitpvrh06kyjpziu.jpeg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c246","name":"carnivores","slug":"carnivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","name":"eating out","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c235","name":"vietnamese","slug":"vietnamese"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c243","name":"mexican","slug":"mexican"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c250","name":"thai","slug":"thai"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f5","name":"san francisco","slug":"san-francisco"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31b","name":"betterlate","slug":"betterlate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31c","name":"than never","slug":"than-never"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31d","name":"monday","slug":"monday"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31e","name":"food crawl","slug":"food-crawl"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31f","name":"ethiopian","slug":"ethiopian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c320","name":"mission","slug":"mission"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c377","uuid":"5ebea30f-90a4-4799-b90f-666b7ffe5d0a","title":"It's about \"Pho\"-king time!","url":"https://cookinginpjs.herokuapp.com/its-about-pho-king-time/","published_at":"31 January, 2015","html":"<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7484/15215553514_6e88dc3524_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Before 2 summers ago, I had never experienced Pho. Once I tasted it, I knew that I had been missing out on something delicious my entire life. Pho is a simple vietnamese noodle soup. Traditionally, it is made with beef or chicken with some meat broth, which gives it its rich flavor. However we found a vegetarian way of mimicking the flavor! There's a great recipe <a href=\"http://ohmyveggies.com/30-minute-vegetarian-pho/\">here</a> that also had some great flavors.</p>\n<p>Pho works best if you have fresh bean sprouts, jalapenos, and basil. When you drop these into your soup, it brings out the most amazing flavors. I also chopped some onions, cilantro and some green onions for a little something extra.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7549/15215550764_63933ed924_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The first step in the process is preparing the stock. My mom and I made a vegetable stock using celery, carrots, and onions among other things. All you need to do is simmer vegetables and herbs in a pot and after 30-40 minutes it should be done! You can also use store bought stock, as that is likely far less labor intensive! If you don't mind chicken or beef broth, feel free to use one of those instead and add some cooked shredded chicken or beef too.</p>\n<p>Next, you want to prepare your noodles - you can buy premade rice noodles, or get dry noodles and cook them yourself. But be careful; if they come pre-cooked and packaged they may be extremely fragile and broken. This is what happened to me, as you can see from my pictures. Ideally, the noodles shouldn't break the minute you pick them up with your chopsticks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7513/15650093948_27967e5c09_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now all that's left for you to do is to pour yourself a bowl of hot broth, toss some noodles, vegetables and garnishes and top it off with some sauces. Personally, I just use a little hoisin sauce and chili garlic sauce but feel free to add soy sauce, sriracha, basically anything you want! The best part about Pho is that it can be easily modified to suit each individual's taste!</p>\n<p>If you haven't already, drop everything you're doing, go to the nearest Vietnamese restaurant and dive into a HUGE bowl of Pho!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5615/15837085352_70e3c9fa9c_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7551/15811883866_29a5cdf02b_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5615/15837085352_70e3c9fa9c_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c235","name":"vietnamese","slug":"vietnamese"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c236","name":"pho","slug":"pho"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"vietnamese","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
