While growing up my mom always used to sing this song\nto me. The song literally translates to \"I'm going to build a house in front of\nyour house.\" It's supposed to be this cute love song where the guy wants to\n\"build his world in front of her house.\" My question is, wouldn't it be more\nromantic if he built a house FOR them WITH her? Why does he only want to be in\nfront of her house? I may be missing some context from the rest of the movie but\nregardless that's a whole different tangent.\n\nThis song was pretty much just my mom telling me she wants to live right across\nthe street from my and constantly spoil her future grandchildren. I'm pretty\nsure my mom wanted a full on re-enactment of \"Everybody loves Raymond.\" But hey,\nwho's gonna complain about a free babysitter and delicious food? :P\n\n**Love you Amma! \n\n(While you're at it, you should also check out her blog here\n[http://uppukhara.com]! It's basically every recipe she made for me growing up\nthat I have random cravings for since I've moved out to California.)\n\nSometimes I feel like I'm not a complete adult yet. Even though I'm currently\nsupporting myself, paying my own bills, taxes, and insurance, I don't always\nfeel like a \"real\" adult. Then, there are times when suddenly I feel like a full\non housewife, which is something I NEVER EVER want to be.\n\nOne such instance was this past weekend, when I was anxiously awaiting the\narrival of my new electric pressure cooker. One thing I'm sure  every child\ngrowing up in an Indian household can relate to, is the sound of a pressure\ncooker. That sound TERRIFIED me to my core throughout my childhood, and to this\nday. I always feel like something somewhere is going to explode. Even in college\nwhen my roommate decided to make dal and turned on the pressure cooker, we used\nto hide behind our bedroom doors waiting for it to go off enough times so could\nturn it off and continue hiding. You'd think that it wouldn't be worth the fear,\nbut honestly have you ever had dal or even better, Bangalore-style saaru? Yea,\nit's worth it. (If you're wondering what that is, it's a less liquidy and better\nversion of rasam with more dal in it). I've tried all sorts of cooking\ntechniques, but saaru just doesn't taste quite the same unless you use a\npressure cooker. And this way, you don't end up wasting hours and hours making\nyour meal. THAT is not worth it.\n\nThe sound of our pressure cooker is even worse for our dog because he can hear\nthe noise WAY before we can. He panics and runs all the way up the stairs and\ncowers near my parent's bedroom door. This happens without fail every time my\nmom STARTS the pressure cooker. He knows it's coming and refuses to come down\nfrom his hiding spot until he's completely sure it's not going to go off again.\nPoor baby. But I'm sure you'll all realize why once you get your own pressure\ncookers!\n\n\n\nBut AHA! What is this?! An ELECTRIC pressure cooker? What is this magical\ndevice? So quiet and effective? Truly this can't be real! But miraculously, IT\nIS!\n\n\n\nI've never been so excited for any adult purchase in my life, except maybe  my\ncar. This was a glorious purchase. NOT ONLY can it make dal in 4 minutes, but I\ncan use it to make dahi (yogurt or curds generally eaten with indian food),\nrice, and basically anything else in life I could ever think of! ALL WITHOUT\nMAKING A SOUND! I didn't even realize it had even started and it made a beeping\nnoise indicating that my food was READY! It's wonderful.\n\nAmidst all this excitement over the pressure cooker, I got kind of homesick for\nmy mom's food. I then proceeded to facetime my mom for an hour while she\ncarefully explained step by step instructions on how to make one of my favorite\nchildhood dishes, Bendekai Huli or for you non-Kannada speaking people out\nthere, Okra Sambar. Most kids hate okra, but honestly it's one of my favorite\nvegetables, especially when it's in Indian food.\n\nI know this might not be the most flattering picture of any of us (mainly my\nbrother) but whatever.\n\nOne thing I will mention is that I am not sure where to get the huli pudi\n(sambar powder). My parents usually bring bags back from this little store in\nBangalore every time anyone visits, but I'm sure you can find something similar\nin local Indian stores. I mean, I know I couldn't live without sambar so I'm\nsure there are other people who feel the same way and have found a way! There\nare also instant mixes available at the Indian store - while these aren't quite\nas good, they can satisfy the occasional craving!\n\nNow that you've learned a little bit of Kannada, and hopefully are as excited as\nI was, let's begin!\n\n\n\nOkra Sambar or Bendekai Huli\nI'm giving these instructions based on my electric pressure cooker. You may have\nto adjust the dal portion of the recipe according to however you make it.\nPressure cookers scare the bejesus out of me so be careful!\n\nIngredients:\nDal\n1 cup toor dal\n 1/2-3/4 tsp turmeric powder\n 2 1/2 cup water\n Sambar\noil\n 1/2-3/4 tsp mustard seeds\n 1 small package frozen okra\n 1/2-3/4 tsp tamarind paste\n 1 1/2 spoons huli powder (sambar powder)\n water\n Directions:\nAdd the toor dal to your pressure cooker and rinse. Add the water and turmeric\nand turn on the pressure cooker. I did the Manual setting for 4 minutes. Also\nmake sure its set to low pressure and all the pieces are in place. When the\npressure cooker was done it went into keep warm (displayed \"L00:00\") and started\ncounting up. I unplugged it and let it release the pressure on its own.\n\nIn a pot, add some oil and mustard seeds on medium heat, this is called vagarne.\nWhen the mustard seeds start popping, add the frozen okra. When the okra starts\nto get kinda sticky and stringy, add the tamarind paste and a little bit of\nwater. Keep cooking and mixing the okra occasionally until it is cooked through.\n\n![](https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/uq45bcrldnses3q369jmzcs1v1srqmqv.jpg)\n Add huli powder and salt to taste and let it come to a boil. Add the dal and\nmore water until it's the right consistency. Taste it as you go. I needed to add\na little more tamarind paste and huli powder to fit my taste but that depends\nperson to person.\n\nLet it cook for a few minutes and enjoy!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/jsq0nkdtbwdws84izepapwnja2t93efo.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d0","name":"homesick","slug":"homesick"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c297","name":"mom","slug":"mom"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b8","name":"puppy","slug":"puppy"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ad","name":"indian","slug":"indian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cc","name":"south indian","slug":"south-indian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d1","name":"pressure cooker","slug":"pressure-cooker"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d2","name":"crock pot","slug":"crock-pot"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d3","name":"okra","slug":"okra"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d4","name":"sambar","slug":"sambar"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c36b","uuid":"8abb8e5a-35f6-448b-a1d9-8decec1d3d4d","title":"Vidhyarthi Bhavan","slug":"vidhyarthi-bhavan","published_at":"01 February, 2016","plaintext":"I'm feeling homesick today. A year ago, I was in India, probably eating chaat\n(Indian street food), or taking pictures of my cousins while they danced around\nwith stuffed animals.\n\n\n\nI miss India a lot. I always loved visiting my family there, and going for eight\nmonths was one of the most valuable times in my life. I loved every minute of\nit.\n\nThis is a post about a breakfast place in Bangalore, Karnataka, India that\neveryone goes to. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEvery city has this restaurant. It's not classically pretty, and there's no one\nwaiting at the door to see whether or not you want to come in. This is a place\nwhere you have to leave your diet at the door (no one has any idea how many\ncalories/protein grams/vats of butter are in your food anyway). The waiters are\ninattentive enough that a newcomer would have left on the spot, and there are\nliterally never enough seats. There are a few places like this in Bangalore (in\na city this big, with this much traffic, you need multiple choice breakfast\nspots), but Vidhyarthi Bhavan is arguably one of the most delicious.\n\nIt's packed to the brim every day; I went on a Monday morning, and we had to\nstand behind people to snake their seats. And after we ate, people were standing\nbehind us to snake ours. The restaurant is famous for it's Masala Dosa, although\nthere are a couple of other items on the menu if you're interested.\n\nWhile you wait for your order, there are gorgeous photos of Mount Kailash, and\nreally interesting pencil sketches of famous poets and writers of India adorning\nthe walls.\n\n\n\nThere's plenty of fodder for people watching, if the smells wafting from the\nkitchen aren't enough to keep you totally occupied. Finally, your order comes\nout.\n\nThe dosas come to you on plates piled high in the waiter's arms (you have a\nbrief moment where you are concerned that the bottom of someone else's plate has\nbeen all over your food); the waiter never actually looks at you before he heads\nto the next table. Then a second waiter, arguably less attentive than the first,\ncomes over with a tureen of coconut, cilantro, and mint chutney and pours it\nonto your plate.\n\nYou dig in with your fingers, barely resisting the urge to just dig in with your\nwhole face. Finishing one of these babies is a task and a half, but you are\ndefinitely up to the challenge; going, going...gone.\n\n\n\nFinally, you get a cup of some excellent filter coffee to finish you right off,\nbefore you stumble into the daylight, and onto a street lined with flower and\nfruit merchants.\n\nYou amble along, sniffing deeply and enjoying the almost-too-full-but-not-quite\nfeeling in your stomach, and all feels right with the world.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/by56r0iw8pjezazv9tvz46spa9zyx530.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c245","name":"india","slug":"india"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ca","name":"masala dosa","slug":"masala-dosa"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","name":"eating out","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cb","name":"indian food","slug":"indian-food"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cc","name":"south indian","slug":"south-indian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cd","name":"bangalore","slug":"bangalore"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ce","name":"vidhyarthi bhavan","slug":"vidhyarthi-bhavan"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cf","name":"nostalgia","slug":"nostalgia"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d0","name":"homesick","slug":"homesick"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"south-indian","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
