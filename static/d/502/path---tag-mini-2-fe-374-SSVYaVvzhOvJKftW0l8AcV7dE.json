Anytime anyone sees their local Girl Scouts at the grocery\nstore, they start drooling and daydreaming of Thin Mints, Tagalongs, Samoa's,\nand Do-si-Dos. Girl Scout cookies are some of my favorite type of cookies in the\nworld. While I may mainly be a fan of the plain shortbread cookies, Trefoils.\nThin mints and Samoa's are America's two favorites.\n\nWhile plunging into the depths of Pinterest one day, I found a recipe for mini\nsamoa donuts. That got me thinking... What if I were to make mini girl scout\nthemed cupcakes. And to make them even better, give them a slight \"adult\" twist.\n\n\n\nNot to toot my own horn, but these donut bites were AMAZING. Although they were \nreally  donuts... but rather cupcakes. They still tasted great. There was\ndefinitely not enough alcohol in any of the desserts to do any damage but the\nslight bourbon taste in the caramel brought out some awesome flavors.\n\nMy cousins and I even had a hard time not finishing up the caramel bourbon sauce\nbefore the donuts were ready. We kept eating spoon by spoon of the creamy\nbooze-ness.\n\nPro Tip:  Drizzle some warm caramel bourbon sauce onto a scoop of ice cream...\nHEAVEN.\n\nWhen I took these desserts to work, they were gone within minutes. Clearly\neveryone else was dying to get their Girl Scout cookie fix like I was. I even\nsaw this guy spooning caramel bourbon sauce into his coffee to make it a little\nmore \"Irish.\" ;)\n\nHere are the recipes for the donut bites. Even if you don't make the bites\nthemselves... you DEFINITELY have to try the Caramel Bourbon sauce. It takes a\nfew minutes to make and is EXTREMELY rewarding.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamoa Donut Bites\nIngredients:\nDonuts:\n1¼ cup all-purpose flour\n ½ tsp salt\n 1¼ tsp baking powder\n 1 tsp vanilla extract\n 1 egg\n ½ cup milk\n ½ tbsp lemon juice\n 2 tbsp butter, melted\n 4 tbsp Southern Comfort Caramel\n Caramel Bourbon Sauce\n1 package melting caramel (about 14 oz)\n 3 tbsp milk\n ¼ tsp salt\n 2 tbsp Souther Comfort Caramel  <h4>Toppings</h4>\n  <li class=\"ingredient\">3 cups unsweetened coconut flakes, toasted</li>\n</div>\n<div class=\"right\">\n  <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n  <div class=\"instructions\">\n    <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

I usually just end up\nmaking really small quantities which barely justifies all the ingredients I\nwould have needed to get to make the desserts. At work I noticed that anytime\nsomeone brought in donuts or anything else, people would hunt the food down and\ndevour it. Figuring this the was the best opportunity to kill two birds with one\nstone, so I whipped up a few batches of the brownies and brought them to work.\n\nFirst, I sent an email to my team and only a few people grabbed some. I thought\nI had made a complete mistake making so many brownies, or maybe I was delusional\nabout how the brownies tasted since I had made them. As a last option, I sent an\nemail out to the whole company and left them in the common area of my floor.\nTwenty minutes later when I went to go check on them, I saw an empty box.\nClearly the brownies had been a huge hit! Now that I've found the perfect group\nto sample all of my treats, I can bake without worries! My coworkers can expect\na flood of baked goods at least once a month from here on out while I use them\nas guinea pigs for all the different desserts I've always wanted to make! :)\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonally, I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake, but these little bites are\namazing. At first when I bit into one, it was perfectly gooey and chocolatey and\nwith a little bit of cheesecake to top off the flavor. I honestly wasn't sure if\nI hadn't cooked them all the way, but after thoroughly inspecting and devouring\na few, I realized that that's just the way the brownies cook! Each brownie was\nperfectly gooey yet filled with flavors just melting in your mouth. The\ncheesecake portion was the perfect compliment for the sweetness of the brownies.\nTry the recipe yourself and let me know how you like it!\n\nChocolate Chip Cheesecake Brownie Bites\nIngredients:\nBrownie Part:\n¾ cup melted unsalted butter\n 1¼ cup sugar\n 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n ¼ tsp salt\n 1 tsp vanilla extract\n 2 large eggs\n ½ cup all-purpose flour\n ¾ cups semi-sweet chocolate chips\n Cheesecake Part:\n8 oz softened cream cheese\n ½ cup sugar\n ¼ tsp vanilla extract\n 1 egg yolk\n Directions:\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees. Spray the cupcake pan with cooking spray and\nkeep it aside. I used a mini cupcake pan but feel free to use a normal size\ncupcake pan if you want bigger brownies!\n\nBrownie Part: Mix the cocoa, sugar, salt, melted butter, and vanilla together.\nMix the eggs into this mixture until the batter is fully mixed. Add the\nchocolate chips (more if you want it super chocolatey :D) and keep aside.\n\nCheesecake Part: In a separate bowl, mix all the cheesecake ingredients together\nuntil smooth.\n\nFill each well in your cupcake pan ¾ full with brownie batter. Add a spoonful of\ncheesecake batter on top of the brownie batter in each well and swirl the\ncheesecake and brownie parts together! Put the pan in the oven and bake for\nabout 20 minutes (I used a 24 mini cupcake pan so it was 20 minutes for me but\nif you have use a smaller/larger pan adjust the time accordingly).","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8772/17361867465_b5793fb7f7_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c272","name":"cheesecake","slug":"cheesecake"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c273","name":"brownies","slug":"brownies"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c274","name":"mini","slug":"mini"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c275","name":"swirl","slug":"swirl"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"mini","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
