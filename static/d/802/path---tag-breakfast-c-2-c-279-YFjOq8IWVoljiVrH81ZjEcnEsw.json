There are many phases of a best friend reunion, according to this <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/kelseydarragh/when-your-bff-comes-to-town#.nsbQEmYJq\">buzzfeed article</a>. Pretty much every single thing in that article happened, except in our friendship instead of drinking our weight in wine, we cook. And eat.</p>\n<p><strong>A LOT OF FOOD</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-12/8/18/enhanced/webdr11/anigif_original-21914-1449616517-5.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I'm pretty sure Anagha spent 50% of her time at my place and the other 50% at her own parents' house. We didn't even do anything most of the time... I would be working and she would be reading at the opposite end of the table. She had also never met the newest addition to my family, Miggy Pramod, who is basically the most adorable dog known to man.</p>\n<p>True to form, they became best friends immediately.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ijnjkbtgaycn5ddhbx2dwakh9gcrq3ua.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Seriously though, who couldn't love a weirdo that sleeps like this regularly?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/j1fczq8yhjzxhz0ae852f1lu4wqdp00s.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Just look at him.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/8429t2jqhh8zkgv3fuc8vszlqh3y8dbj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This past August, my dad decided that my mom's birthday gift would be to finally get a puppy. My entire family, brimming with excitement, spent hours and hours looking on petfinder.com and various shelter sites for the perfect little CALM addition to our family. After countless shelter visits and close calls with various puppies, we were extremely tired and disheartened. The process of finding the perfect dog for our family had become a lot more emotionally draining than we had originally thought. My mom wasn't sure if she could get attached to another dog and see him/her join another family. Then one day, my parents went to this small little animal hospital in Sterling Heights, MI and instantly became smitten with, what we were told, was a little beagle mix. He was an adorable 18 pound ball of affection who just wanted to play. One week later, he was ready to come home.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/dcypl744jtl2r4ey4gb8xydob6hi09g6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>He was a VERY little 5 month old puppy. Little did we know that the tiny little boy that we brought home was a little more German Shepherd than Beagle. Currently, Miggy is a happy 40 pounds and the obsession of my entire family, weird sleeping positions, ear licking fetishes and all.</p>\n<p>ANYWAYS putting the puppy love aside, whenever we weren't spoiling Miggles with never ending attention, we were watching Netflix and eating All The Brunch. If it hasn't become obvious from some of our <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/brunch-conquers-all/\">previous posts</a>, We <strong>LOVE</strong> brunch. Best of all, it means that we can roll out of bed in our pajamas and enjoy some scrumptiousness that we could concoct using eggs and veggies. Yay Pajamas! YAY Brunch!</p>\n<p>Then, it's time for a relaxing, vacation time food coma. There's that one episode of friends where Joey and Ross discover that they are each other's best nap buddies. Exactly. Who <em>DOESN'T</em> want a nap buddy and best of all your best friend?! So we spent most of our afternoons watching Netflix and chilling (no not like that you perv!) but literally watching Netflix reruns and napping with my puppy.</p>\n<p><strong>Best. Break. Ever.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://45.media.tumblr.com/78bddaf03bdfb59b75a09a3c3db38b10/tumblr_ngbxx0rIAb1snhpyjo1_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We also love Mexican food. No explanation needed. It's just the best. So OBVIOUSLY nothing could be better than combining the two things we are always craving. In came chilaquiles.</p>\n<p>I've had varieties of chilaquiles in the past. From the beaches of Cancun to the streets of San Francisco and San Diego. Everywhere, they put their own spin on the classic Mexican dish. Traditionally it's kept very simple with just fried tortillas, salsa, egg, and beans (and/or meat). California, on the other hand, tends to add avocado to everything so it's very colorful. Our variation probably includes WAY more vegetables than most but I love it and it tasted delicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fco4k8iom9446zmbd42f9dby9n7o3cmn.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/9r2pggwyj4j7fre2tlxu47nhkj2be8mh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/3g098w0hj52qe8k9d45ddalcfxo4a2oh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/eb3enu78qybtf2rl2qygx4gx64l9r7zn.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Chilaquiles</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 bottle <a href=\"http://www.lavictoria.com/products/salsa/thickn-chunky-salsa-verde-medium/\">Salsa Verde</a></li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 bag tortilla chips</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 can black beans</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\"><a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/estoy-cantando/\">Sumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning</a></li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 avocado cubed</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg per person</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">sour cream</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">cheese (shredded or Cotija)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">chopping cilantro to garnish</li>\n        <h4>Pico De Gallo Salsa</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 roma tomatoes</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 onion diced</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">lemon juice to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">salt to taste</li>\n        <h4>Corn Salsa</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 can sweet corn kernels</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">4 sliced jalapeños (more or less based on your spice tolerance)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">lemon juice to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">salt to taste</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Put two handfuls of tortilla chips in a pan and cover with the salsa verde.

Cronut Fever. A chef in New York City decided that he would take croissant dough and fry it like a donut. This scrumptious flaky dessert became <strong>SO</strong> popular that there was even a black market for them! People would pay $100 on the black market for a cronut that could be bought for $5 if they waited in line for a day.</p>\n<p>I'd never tasted a cronut before in my life, so I decided to make use of a bunch of stale croissants I had lying around after a road trip. I tore the croissants into bite size pieces and fried them in hot oil and count to 4. Quickly flip each cronut and fry again for 4 counts. Make sure not to cook them for too long or they get a little too crunchy and burn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uItKVRYVHXTTy-8axm084k_HfxLO6xzEZdPLVsRCD4KB=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Place the fried bites onto paper towels to drain any excess oil. When cooled, drizzle with any icing of your choice or enjoy them by themselves!</p>\n<p>They were flaky yet crunchy, salty yet buttery. It was amazing! I completely understand what the fuss was in New York City at the time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t7G8JSAQTWhF4tYo7phZ4pW0JmJUR3wW9tfbTtKWJiYd=s800\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jSVFKsebGkxhYqNYuiNsVIhtieIrE3c0NZTu-IJJw5VK=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>However, I learned a few things while making these. Making them with store-bought croissants is fine, however you get the proper ratio of flakiness to fried crunchiness when you use croissant dough. It is also easier not to burn them while frying when you use dough. I am not a huge fan of too much oil, so frying the croissants wasn't my favorite. Maybe there's a way to shallow fry them where they won't pick up too much oil, but I have no idea. Next time I try making cronut bites, I will try to bake store-bought croissants and see if that makes a difference. Who knows!</p>\n<p>For the mean time, I completely suggest you try making these at home! They're simple to make and taste amazing! If you're too lazy then I'd recommend going to your local pastry shop and seeing if they make something similar!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_h3gaGiFbUHaUe_a9dnjOu6yMLoZv8oXEt19I2f1god5=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I3bLdLcbLHBZH2QIeDqAX55etYu-5I1Tz94-7LJ62KRW=s800","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23d","name":"brunch","slug":"brunch"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23f","name":"breakfast","slug":"breakfast"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c27d","name":"donuts","slug":"donuts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c283","name":"cronut","slug":"cronut"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c284","name":"fried","slug":"fried"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c285","name":"croissant","slug":"croissant"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c383","uuid":"64999048-482e-4f3b-9b9b-dc46e14cb5c8","title":"Brunch Conquers All","url":"https://cookinginpjs.herokuapp.com/brunch-conquers-all/","published_at":"14 February, 2015","html":"<p><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2947/15238764929_dee408af1f_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When I was younger, my family rarely did breakfast all together; on weekdays we were all rushing around, and on weekends we would all emerge from our rooms at our own times, grazing on whatever acceptable breakfast food was around. For many years, breakfast on Saturday meant spending the entire morning alone on the couch, watching cartoons, dodging my mother's attempts to make me a productive citizen, and eating sugary cereal with abandon. Occasionally, we would have guests and my mother would cook some traditional Indian breakfast items - dosa, roti, upma, etc. - and we would have brunch. But these days were usually paired with pre and post cleaning and formal clothing, so while we loved the company, the whole situation was no bueno.</p>\n<p>It wasn't until I got to college that I really understood brunch. On our campus, Landon dining hall had the most amazing brunch you can imagine - everything from ice cream to omelettes to fresh fruit and berries was represented, and you could literally eat your heart out. In addition to that, we lived in close proximity to Golden Harvest, a small brunch area in Lansing that has a following that borders on obsessive. In East Lansing, brunch does not just pass you by, and from the minute I stepped into Landon, with a slight headache and stomache, craving grease and comfort food, I was a convert.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8656/16296194440_27d1c24829_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Brunch is neither breakfast nor lunch; it's an in between meal, and as such, doesn't have the conventions of the other two. You can enjoy some giggle juice with brunch. You can dip strawberries in chocolate and throw it on a waffle with sugar and it won't count as dessert. You can show up all smelly at your best friend's house at eleven o'clock, post late wake up call and workout, demand eggs, toast, and avocados, and call THAT brunch.</p>\n<p>You can wake up at eight AM and race to Golden Harvest, wait in line for over an hour and a half in the freezing cold, and earn your brunch. Or you can have a lie in at home and make yourself some waffles or toast and watch television, and it could be the most lovely brunch you'll ever have.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7560/15811864496_20a9e2f76e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Brunch is the most welcoming of the meals.</p>\n<p>Brunch is patient, brunch is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Brunch does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Brunch never fails.*</p>\n<p>Brunch is love, y'all. Show someone a little love and pan fry some potatoes and throw a poached egg on top. Give yourself a little treat and stick an overeasy fried egg in a sandwhich with some mixed greens and tomatoes. Use avocado liberally, and consider experimenting with sriracha and truffle oil. Kale and white sugar are both invited to this party, because brunch does not discriminate.</p>\n<p>Let your creative juices and chocolate sauce flow; brunch is a meal without protocol or limitations, and you definitely deserve that business in your life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5612/15837068312_eeff7d20e1_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>*I took some creative licenses with Corinthians 13:4-8a.
