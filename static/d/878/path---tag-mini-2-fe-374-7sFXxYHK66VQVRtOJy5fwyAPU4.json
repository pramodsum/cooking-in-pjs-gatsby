Anytime anyone sees their local Girl Scouts at the grocery store, they start drooling and daydreaming of Thin Mints, Tagalongs, Samoa's, and Do-si-Dos. Girl Scout cookies are some of my favorite type of cookies in the world. While I may mainly be a fan of the plain shortbread cookies, Trefoils. Thin mints and Samoa's are America's two favorites.</p>\n<p>While plunging into the depths of Pinterest one day, I found a recipe for mini samoa donuts. That got me thinking... What if I were to make mini girl scout themed cupcakes. And to make them even better, give them a slight &quot;adult&quot; twist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LVZHqaB-oL-fVWQXFOi2BHG5JYGj8Y-hcensdE9O9mSA=w1312-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Not to toot my own horn, but these donut bites were <em>AMAZING</em>. Although they were <em>really</em> donuts... but rather cupcakes. They still tasted great. There was definitely not enough alcohol in any of the desserts to do any damage but the slight bourbon taste in the caramel brought out some awesome flavors.</p>\n<p>My cousins and I even had a hard time not finishing up the caramel bourbon sauce before the donuts were ready. We kept eating spoon by spoon of the creamy booze-ness.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Drizzle some warm caramel bourbon sauce onto a scoop of ice cream... HEAVEN.</p>\n<p>When I took these desserts to work, they were gone within minutes. Clearly everyone else was dying to get their Girl Scout cookie fix like I was. I even saw this guy spooning caramel bourbon sauce into his coffee to make it a little more &quot;Irish.&quot; ;)</p>\n<p>Here are the recipes for the donut bites. Even if you don't make the bites themselves... you DEFINITELY have to try the Caramel Bourbon sauce. It takes a few minutes to make and is EXTREMELY rewarding.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BYvxNbTPOJb518dtM6jLTZ9gwTDpQpmuj15u6oPPormA=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pk7bQdao45MiJPXztLw3P1jt6yLFAw5g-mIGogM4G2O5=w1458-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Samoa Donut Bites</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <h4>Donuts:</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ tsp baking powder</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ cup milk</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ tbsp lemon juice</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp butter, melted</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">4 tbsp Southern Comfort Caramel</li>\n      <h4>Caramel Bourbon Sauce</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 package melting caramel (about 14 oz)</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">3 tbsp milk</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp Souther Comfort Caramel</li>\n<pre><code>  &lt;h4&gt;Toppings&lt;/h4&gt;\n  &lt;li class=&quot;ingredient&quot;&gt;3 cups unsweetened coconut flakes, toasted&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;h3 id=&quot;directions&quot;&gt;Directions:&lt;/h3&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

I usually just end up making really small quantities which barely justifies all the ingredients I would have needed to get to make the desserts. At work I noticed that anytime someone brought in donuts or anything else, people would hunt the food down and devour it. Figuring this the was the best opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, so I whipped up a few batches of the brownies and brought them to work.</p>\n<p>First, I sent an email to my team and only a few people grabbed some. I thought I had made a complete mistake making so many brownies, or maybe I was delusional about how the brownies tasted since I had made them. As a last option, I sent an email out to the whole company and left them in the common area of my floor. Twenty minutes later when I went to go check on them, I saw an empty box. Clearly the brownies had been a huge hit! Now that I've found the perfect group to sample all of my treats, I can bake without worries! My coworkers can expect a flood of baked goods at least once a month from here on out while I use them as guinea pigs for all the different desserts I've always wanted to make! :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7711/17154413587_86e925b5aa_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7766/16741602133_ec8f6f5fc7_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Personally, I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake, but these little bites are amazing. At first when I bit into one, it was perfectly gooey and chocolatey and with a little bit of cheesecake to top off the flavor. I honestly wasn't sure if I hadn't cooked them all the way, but after thoroughly inspecting and devouring a few, I realized that that's just the way the brownies cook! Each brownie was perfectly gooey yet filled with flavors just melting in your mouth. The cheesecake portion was the perfect compliment for the sweetness of the brownies. Try the recipe yourself and let me know how you like it!</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Chocolate Chip Cheesecake Brownie Bites</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <h4>Brownie Part:</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ cup melted unsalted butter</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup sugar</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 large eggs</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ cup all-purpose flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>\n      <h4>Cheesecake Part:</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">8 oz softened cream cheese</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ cup sugar</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg yolk</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
