To be honest, I thought it was an all-American thing (immigrant probs, amirite?) So I researched - and I found out that historically, sweet potato pie was a food slaves made in the south. And I had no idea until I made it and someone else called me out on it!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/iw7ilzj11mwwevcfd9rwv4255nyunmla.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Here's the thing about cultural appropriation in food - it happens ALL THE TIME. People love to take foods from other cultures - frequently every day, commonplace foods - and remake them with slight tweaks and giant price tags. So how do you avoid it? I personally advocate for research.</p>\n<p>I think it's important to know where the food you're making comes from, especially when you're modifying it. I tend to modify a lot of recipes to make them vegetarian or vegan, but I try to do it in a way that feels as respectful to me as possible.</p>\n<p>I think there's space in food for innovation, but it has to be accompanied by respect for the important place that food has in culture.</p>\n<p>So, the moral of this story? Don't appropriate. Don't glorify the food of another culture without trying to understand that culture itself. Accept that you'll probably be clueless even with additional information, and do your best to be respectful.</p>\n<p>And also, have some pie.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/b9pw4yztlvyi87dno5qfnd1tryy08fyw.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Sweet Potato Pie</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>This is a filling dessert.

The pie crust recipe is the same dough as that of my  [Love Triangles](http://cookinginpjs.com/love_triangles/) from last week. The first time I did it, I added a little bit too much ice water - perhaps a couple tablespoons too much - and I wound up with a loose dough I didn't want to add more flour to. So that time, I rolled it out hastily, trying not to handle it too much to avoid the coconut oil melting prior to baking. This time I managed to avoid that pitfall, and carefully added only as much water as was necessary, resulting in a soft, elastic, and close-to-perfect dough. I recommend prepping and chilling that before you do anything else.  \n</p><p>\n2.) I went the simple route; I chopped the sweet potato small, into pieces about a half inch wide. After you do that, douse them in spices and throw them in the oven until they are melt-in-your-mouth cooked. Or, you know, about thirty minutes.\n</p><p>\n3.) Mashed them, add maple syrup, the some almond butter, or the liquid from a can of coconut milk for creaminess, and your spices and extracts. You want to make sure it isn't too sweet, tasting every time you add a new ingredient to - ahem - \"assess quality.\" Make sure that the pie isn't so sweet that you can't taste the sweet potato. The goal is to enhance it so it can be the star, not mask it. \n</p><p>\n4.) Preheat the oven to 375 F. Take out your pie dough which has, of course, chilled for at least four hours at this point, and roll it out gently. Set it into a pie pan/tin, and crimp the edges however you're like. Reserve the cut off bits to create a decoration for your pie. Pop the crust in the oven for about fifteen minutes. \n</p><p>\n5.) After the pie crust has baked for about fifteen, take the pie out of the oven and layer in your filling. You want it to be up until the rim of the pie pan - this filling won't expand, so you can fill it right up. Put the pie back in the oven for about twenty minutes. \n</p><p>\n6.) In the meantime, roll out your spare dough and get creative! I went the way of stars and diamonds because those are the cookie cutters I found, but the world is your oyster. When twenty minutes have passed, take your pie out of the oven and carefully place the decorations on top. Put it back in for another 20 minutes. Proceed to turn on the oven light and watch excitedly, as I did (I think I mistook it for a television).\n</p><p>\n7.) After another twenty minutes have passed, increase the oven temperature to 400 F, and place your pies on the top rack - I like my top crust to be a little brown, and this makes that happen!\n</p><p>\n8.) Take your pie out of the oven and serve it up! I loved it with a dollop of coconut whipped cream, but it would likely also taste good with ice cream, or normal whipped cream, or any manner of things. It was also excellent all on its own. \n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n","title":"Sweet Potato Pie","slug":"sweet-potato-pie","published_at":"25 January, 2016","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/1me34o8e4hrj5zs0hqullpkoduharuvp.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c3","slug":"sweetpotato"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c24b","slug":"pumpkin-pie"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bc","slug":"pastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c4","slug":"piecrust"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c5","slug":"vegetarian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]},"next":{"html":"<p>I know.

I was not aware that this was an <em>ACTUAL</em> holiday but I'm not gonna complain. I firmly believe that everyday should be National Chocolate Cake Day! But hey, I'll take one day a year.</p>\n<p>Second, it's your lucky week! You get TWO whole posts from me! I've been sick since Sunday, so I've been vegetating on my couch, watching a few too many chick flicks, all whilst drinking the world's supply of ginger chai <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/an-ode-to-chai/\">(hence my caffeine-fueled poem on Sunday which you should also totally read and appreciate)</a>.</p>\n<p>So, let's get to it!</p>\n<p>As the self-designated baker for my friend group, I've been baking birthday cakes for pretty much everyone. I've been trying to tailor each cake to something either they've specifically requested or what I think they would enjoy. This cake in particular was for one of my friends who loves whiskey. Her only requirement was that, and I quote, &quot;I do not kill her.&quot; I took it as a challenge in that I was going to put as much alcohol as possible in the cake while retaining its ability to taste good.</p>\n<p>Three things happened with this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I made a deliciously boozy cake</li>\n<li>I finished a LOT of the whiskey bottle I bought for this very specific purpose.</li>\n<li>I ended up getting fairly tipsy after a few batter taste tests</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>I also feel like I should include a warning: raw batter means raw eggs which also means the potential for salmonella. So be careful not to eat spoonfuls of your cake batter! That could get you very sick. Enjoy responsibly ;)</em></p>\n<p>Honestly, I'd say it was a completely successful experience. I totally recommend making boozy desserts to everyone (of legal age of course). :P Just don't expect to be productive after you put the cake in the oven. I had absolutely no attention span once I set that cake to bake. I ended up making one GIANT cake for my friend, another little one for the rest of us to enjoy on our own, and a few cupcakes for my coworkers to enjoy. I kid you not, I was swarmed and the cupcakes were gone within 20 minutes of me sending an email announcing the arrival of whiskey cupcakes. I'm now officially known as the dessert lady at work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zh4hcqy50kwhftm3na4bh6oy0944s31z.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Chocolate Whiskey Cake</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to increase/decrease the amount of whiskey according to your taste/tolerance.

I felt it might be a little TOO much if I spiked that too, so I just spread shit tons of frosting on top of the cake/cupcakes and ate it. I'd say that was the better choice! If you're going easy on the whiskey inside the cake itself (or in the words of my friend, &quot;are being a little bitch&quot;), then maybe you can spike the frosting. Otherwise you've got enough alcohol in there to get the deed done.</p>\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-2.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-3.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-10.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-15.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-9.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-11.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-12.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-13.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Yes.
