The ice cream maker bowl wouldn't freeze, even after 48 hours in the freezer. And then the ice cream itself failed to freeze after eight hours in the freezer. It was still delicious, but delicious with the consistency of soft serve, rather than hard ice cream.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/gcws27i9ca8jn5gkqd2j6osakirvt43d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Basically, I made fro yo.

First things first, put your ice cream maker's bowl in the freezer, and chill your coconut milk in the fridge overnight before you start. \n</p><p>\n2.) Put your strawberries, blueberries, juice, and maple syrup into a saucepan and let simmer. When the fruit is about halfway to being complete mush, move to step 3. \n</p><p>\n3.) Crack open your coconut milk and pour into the blender. Add the maple syrup, and carefully remove some of the juice that's in your saucepan, and add it as well. This cuts down on simmering time for the jam, and adds color and flavor to the ice cream! Blend. \n</p><p> \n4.) While the fruit continues to cook, take about 3/4 of the coconut milk you've blended up and put it in a container. Then add the arrowroot or cornstarch, and blend the remaining 1/4 until fully combined. Pour into container with the rest of the coconut milk base. \n</p><p> \n5.) Your fruit should be complete mush now - if there's any juice left, now is the time to slowly pour it into the ice cream base, until there's only a couple of tablespoons of liquid in the saucepan with the fruit. \n</p><p>\n6.) Carefully sprinkle the arrowroot or cornstarch onto the fruit, stirring vigorously to prevent clumping. Allow to cook an additional couple of minutes, until the mixture has thickened just a bit. Remove from heat, and pour into a container. \n</p><p>\n7.) Put the coconut milk base and jam into the fridge - both need to chill for a bit, at least twelve hours, ideally 24 or more. \n</p><p>\n8.) Climb a tree, read a book, explore nature. Go to work? You do you, boo boo. \n</p><p>\n9.) When all ingredients are thoroughly chilled, follow the directions on your ice cream maker! When there are five - ten minutes left, add the jam, and allow to incorporate completely. \n</p><p>\n10.) Eat ice cream in February. Don't let THE MAN tell you what to do. \n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/gcws27i9ca8jn5gkqd2j6osakirvt43d.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2df","name":"ice cream","slug":"ice-cream"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","name":"vegan","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","name":"sugarrush","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e0","name":"coconut milk","slug":"coconut-milk"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e1","name":"berries","slug":"berries"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e2","name":"summertime","slug":"summertime"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e3","name":"sweet treats","slug":"sweet-treats"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e4","name":"fight the power","slug":"fight-the-power"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e5","name":"i stand with planned parenthood","slug":"i-stand-with-planned-parenthood"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e6","name":"and black lives matter","slug":"and-black-lives-matter"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e7","name":"and native nations","slug":"and-native-nations"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e8","name":"power to the people","slug":"power-to-the-people"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"power-to-the-people","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
