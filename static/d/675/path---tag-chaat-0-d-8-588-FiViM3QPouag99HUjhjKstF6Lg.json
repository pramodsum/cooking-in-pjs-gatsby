When I was there, I ate a ton of food. All of\nmy family members were happy to feed me, and between the amazing home cooking,\nand the delicious food available on every street corner, it's almost a miracle\nthat I didn't pack on pounds.\n\nI am, generally, pretty picky about my food. I waver between being vegan and\nvegetarian, and I'm usually pretty careful about ingredients I allow in my\nkitchen. But, like everyone else, I have a fatal flaw and it's this; I love\nstreet food.\n\nI know that someone involved didn't wash their hands, I know that the\ningredients aren't always top notch, I know that the fat, salt, and sugar\ncontent is probably WAY higher than anything I should be consuming. But I don't\nparticularly care.\n\nIn India a \"gaadi\" is a vehicle, and \"chaat\" is street food that has fresh\nvegetable, puffed rice, sweet and spicy sauces, and some fried components. So\n\"gaadi chaat\" is street food you get out of a flat bed cart.\n\nIn Bangalore, there's a street people refer to as \"chaat street,\" and the street\nis lined with street food vendors. One end has a bakery, and the other end (the\nend I like to start on) has a few fruit carts, and one \"corn\" cart. I usually\nget my corn spiced with salt and chili, and mixed with raw, unripe mangoes\n(delicious!)\n\n\n\nThen it's time for Masala Chaat! This is one of my absolute favorites; it\nfeatures a thick, spicy lentil soup layered atop crispy, crackly puris (indian\n\"chips\" and under sweet and spicy chutney, some fresh onion and cilantro, and a\nsprinkle of \"chaat masala.\"\n\n\n\nIt's The Chaat Shop!\n\nNext up: Gobi Manchurian. Cauliflower dipped in dough and deep fried, then\ndredged in fresh onion and cilantro, and delicious, spicy, tomato-ey garlic-y\nsauces.\n\n\n\nThis is the Gobi Manchurian man! He also makes noodles. He is obviously\nsupremely talented.\n\nNow that you're ALMOST too full (because you've eaten your way down the street)\nit's time for dessert! There's a bakery you can step into, vendors with all\nkinds of sweets and shaved ice, and (my personal favorite) Mango Kulfi!\n\n\n\nGo to bed. It's been a long day, and you're long overdue for a satisfying food\ncoma.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zw9hrme823kt4bmwzy4plu5w9jcwdkmz.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d5","name":"chaat","slug":"chaat"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c245","name":"india","slug":"india"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d6","name":"street food","slug":"street-food"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"chaat","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
