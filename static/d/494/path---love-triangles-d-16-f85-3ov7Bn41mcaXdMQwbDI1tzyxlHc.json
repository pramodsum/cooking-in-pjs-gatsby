They weren't tarts, they weren't REALLY puff pastry either, and I couldn't figure out what to call them. And then, as I was talking to a friend about it, we got into a conversation about euphemisms, and the ones we both favor. Hot box got thrown around a bit, but then we hit on the perfect name. Visually accurate (the pastries are triangles) and a little silly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/praw2vkc61bu1p72w4hn5xgo6d1t6au8.jpg\" alt=\"alt\"></p>\n<p>Love Triangles.</p>\n<p>And look, I know it says vegan up there at the top, and I can hear what you're thinking: you don't usually like vegan pastry! It's dry, or it's weird, and are there lentils in there because you heard that vegans put lentils in everything!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/uadohrf9za1k4nditck5cldqmhr0ea7e.jpg\" alt=\"alt\"></p>\n<p>But these pastries don't taste vegan. I think there's this idea that vegan food has to be healthy, and taste healthy, and while I would definitely advocate for healthy food generally, that's not the case here. This recipe is full of lovely fats in the form of coconut oil, and yummy yummy carbs. It's delicious. You won't believe it's not butter in there. The pastry is flaky and crisp at the same time, the apples are tender and perfectly cooked, and the pecans add a hint of interest inside.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fk0f07cwosnzlj8tc0a9uchxdyegmsxz.jpg\" alt=\"alt\"></p>\n<p>It's a teeny weeny pie to warm the bits of your soul that have been snowed into.

Just note that the chilling instructions aren't really optional; the whole point is to keep the coconut oil intact throughout the preparation, so that when it gets into the oven, it melts into the pastry creating flakiness and richness. Without chilling items appropriately, the dough becomes too difficult to work with, and it doesn't cook properly in the oven. So. Chill out. Chill your dough, chill your baking trays, chill your filling. Your stomach will thank you later.</em></p>\n      <p>Yield: 16 mini pastries</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"time\">\n      <p><strong>Total Time:</strong> <span class=\"duration\">1 hour active, four hours passive</span></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\"><h4>Pastry Dough</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 C Unbleached All Purpose Flour</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">1 teaspoon salt</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">3/4 C Coconut Oil, cold but pliable</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">Ice Water, 1/4 cup - 1 cup, as needed</li>\n        <h4>Filling</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">4 Medium Apples, preferably a variety, cored and grated</li>\n          <li class=\"2/3 C Sugar</li>\n<li class=\" ingredient\"=\"\">1/2 Tsp.

Put flour and salt in a mixing bowl, and mix together thoroughly. Add the coconut oil and crumble it in with your fingers, until you have a mixture that looks a little sandy - the coconut oil should not disappear completely, but should be in small pea-sized or smaller chunks. Add ice water a tablespoon at a time until you have a dough that's smooth, not too dry, and fairly elastic.\n</p><p> \n2.) Roll out the dough into a rectangle, about 6x11. Fold the two short ends in, so that you have a rectangle one third the size of the original. Then roll it out again to roughly the same size, and fold again from the short ends. Repeat this process seven or eight times - this is what creates the layers in your pastry, and I found that while this method takes time, it was not too strenuous and yielded good results. \n</p><p> \n3.) Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Let chill for a minimum of four hours. This dough can be chilled for several days, so it works really well if you're trying to make it in advance. \n</p><p> \n4.) Now it's time for the filling! Put your cored and grated apples into a saucepan, and turn on the heat. Add sugar and spices, and mix thoroughly. Allow the apples to become soft and fragrant; any juice produced should evaporate, so that you have mixture without extra moisture.\n</p><p>\n5.) Once apples are cooked through, add extracts and cook for one minute. Take off the heat and add lime juice and pecans. Stir completely before setting in fridge to chill. The filling needs to be cold before you make your pastries, so that it doesn't melt the coconut oil prematurely. \n</p><p>\n6.) Grease two cookie trays with coconut oil and chill in the fridge or freezer.\n</p><p> \n7.) Let three - four hours pass. Read a book. Take a long walk, or a short hike. Watch some television, or make animals out of passing clouds. \n</p><p> \n8.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Take your chilled dough out of the fridge and cut into 16 pieces with a sharp knife. Take one piece and roll it into a ball, and set on a floured surface. Roll it out into a circle about 4 - 5 inches in diameter. \n</p><p>\n9.) Place about a tablespoon of filling in the middle of the circle, and dot the circumference with water, to make sure it sticks. Fold the dough on three sides, so that the base forms a triangle. Press the dough together as shown in the pictures below, so that the seams meet in the center. Set it onto your chilled baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. You might have some filling leftover, depending on the size of your apples. \n![alt](https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/a5avl89yja4umc0kd06f96jnrymm9c1s.jpg)\n</p><p>\n10.) Bake for thirty five - forty five minutes. The tops should be golden brown and crispy, and some of the apple juices will escape onto the tray. That's okay. \n</p><p> \n11.) When they're done, take them out, and wait for them to cool. Or, if you're like me, pick one up, bite in, mouth breathe until it cools, and then lament the fact that your burned the roof of your mouth. It's fine. These taste great with a bit of vanilla ice cream (vegan or otherwise), a warm cup of tea, or just on their own as well.  \n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b4","name":"warmapplepie","slug":"warmapplepie-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b5","name":"allamerican","slug":"allamerican-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","name":"vegan","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b7","name":"veganpastry","slug":"veganpastry-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bc","name":"pastry","slug":"pastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bd","name":"puffpastry","slug":"puffpastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","name":"sugarrush","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"love_triangles","previous":{"html":"<p>We all love Ross.

My entire family, brimming with excitement, spent hours and hours looking on petfinder.com and various shelter sites for the perfect little CALM addition to our family. After countless shelter visits and close calls with various puppies, we were extremely tired and disheartened. The process of finding the perfect dog for our family had become a lot more emotionally draining than we had originally thought. My mom wasn't sure if she could get attached to another dog and see him/her join another family. Then one day, my parents went to this small little animal hospital in Sterling Heights, MI and instantly became smitten with, what we were told, was a little beagle mix. He was an adorable 18 pound ball of affection who just wanted to play. One week later, he was ready to come home.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/dcypl744jtl2r4ey4gb8xydob6hi09g6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>He was a VERY little 5 month old puppy. Little did we know that the tiny little boy that we brought home was a little more German Shepherd than Beagle. Currently, Miggy is a happy 40 pounds and the obsession of my entire family, weird sleeping positions, ear licking fetishes and all.</p>\n<p>ANYWAYS putting the puppy love aside, whenever we weren't spoiling Miggles with never ending attention, we were watching Netflix and eating All The Brunch. If it hasn't become obvious from some of our <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/brunch-conquers-all/\">previous posts</a>, We <strong>LOVE</strong> brunch. Best of all, it means that we can roll out of bed in our pajamas and enjoy some scrumptiousness that we could concoct using eggs and veggies. Yay Pajamas! YAY Brunch!</p>\n<p>Then, it's time for a relaxing, vacation time food coma. There's that one episode of friends where Joey and Ross discover that they are each other's best nap buddies. Exactly. Who <em>DOESN'T</em> want a nap buddy and best of all your best friend?! So we spent most of our afternoons watching Netflix and chilling (no not like that you perv!) but literally watching Netflix reruns and napping with my puppy.</p>\n<p><strong>Best. Break. Ever.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://45.media.tumblr.com/78bddaf03bdfb59b75a09a3c3db38b10/tumblr_ngbxx0rIAb1snhpyjo1_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We also love Mexican food. No explanation needed. It's just the best. So OBVIOUSLY nothing could be better than combining the two things we are always craving. In came chilaquiles.</p>\n<p>I've had varieties of chilaquiles in the past. From the beaches of Cancun to the streets of San Francisco and San Diego. Everywhere, they put their own spin on the classic Mexican dish. Traditionally it's kept very simple with just fried tortillas, salsa, egg, and beans (and/or meat). California, on the other hand, tends to add avocado to everything so it's very colorful. Our variation probably includes WAY more vegetables than most but I love it and it tasted delicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fco4k8iom9446zmbd42f9dby9n7o3cmn.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/9r2pggwyj4j7fre2tlxu47nhkj2be8mh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/3g098w0hj52qe8k9d45ddalcfxo4a2oh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/eb3enu78qybtf2rl2qygx4gx64l9r7zn.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Chilaquiles</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 bottle <a href=\"http://www.lavictoria.com/products/salsa/thickn-chunky-salsa-verde-medium/\">Salsa Verde</a></li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 bag tortilla chips</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 can black beans</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\"><a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/estoy-cantando/\">Sumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning</a></li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 avocado cubed</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg per person</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">sour cream</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">cheese (shredded or Cotija)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">chopping cilantro to garnish</li>\n        <h4>Pico De Gallo Salsa</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 roma tomatoes</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 onion diced</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">lemon juice to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">salt to taste</li>\n        <h4>Corn Salsa</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 can sweet corn kernels</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">4 sliced jalapeños (more or less based on your spice tolerance)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">lemon juice to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">salt to taste</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Put two handfuls of tortilla chips in a pan and cover with the salsa verde.
