I was deprived of social interaction to such a point that I legit LOL'd at a Buzzfeed article of ridiculous snapchats for a good 20 minutes. And by LOL'd I mean curled over laughing so hard I could barely breathe. No Buzzfeed article is THAT funny. I had such bad sinus pain that working on my computer for long periods of time was pretty rough. So I decided rather than wallowing in my bed, I was going to make SOME productive use of my time... baking for you guys!</p>\n<p>I found this recipe on Pinterest a while back of <a href=\"http://www.carlsbadcravings.com/cream-cheese-stuffed-chocolate-chip-banana-coffee-cake-recipe/\">Cream Cheese Filled Chocolate Chip Banana Coffee Cake</a>. I do want to preface my recipe with this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I didn't some of the ingredients so this is my altered version for lazy bakers :)</li>\n<li>I also don't have a bundt cake pan, so mine didn't come out as gorgeous looking as this but there is one thing I CAN guarantee, which is that they came out DELICIOUS. Probably one of my favorite desserts I've ever made, next to Tiramisu and my mom's Mush Cake.</li>\n<li>I didn't have brown sugar and didn't want to bother making a second grocery store trip for that so I just didn't bother making the streusel topping that was in the original recipe. I can only imagine how much more mind blowing it would have been had I added the streusel, maybe you can make yours with it and let me know!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/1tjouximy6nxjmeaomjqkrsd4i5ouqxi.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Over the last few weeks I've been trying to figure out where in my new apartment I can do my food photography to optimize the natural light coming from my windows. In my old apartment it was extremely easy, I had giant sliding doors which brought in ALL the light and shown over pretty much my entire living room; and if that wasn't enough then I could go out onto my balcony and take the photos there! It was perfect. This week I discovered that if I angle one of my side tables properly and place the dish inside it, the light reflects off the walls of the table perfectly onto the the food and really brings out all the details in the food! I HAD FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT! Although this weird positioning did lead to some old people back pain for me because of the weird positions that I laid in on the floor to get these photos. Such is the pain for beauty.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/l2l9lmho8q088kczuewl9ll8ec4uz2b8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I mean just look at it...</p>\n<p>This is one recipe I would HIGHLY recommend you try, whether it be my interpretation or the original recipe itself.

A specific friend of mine, <em>cough cough Breane</em>, had requested the recipe so I TOTALLY apologize for my brain fart and promise I'll post it next week! But until then, you'll have to bear with me and enjoy this post instead :).</p>\n<p>So personally, I think my mom is the QUEEN of making banana bread. Like, seriously. Her banana bread the most glorious thing since, well, sliced bread (badum chhhhhhhhh). It's the perfect combination soft and moist and not too sweet. Of course, my banana bread can never live up to that standard but, hey, I can try!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/kvkxvgrndzsbsfjbpa938jq142jrlgpl.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>One thing I've learned about all of my mom's recipes is that her measurements aren't always... Exact. She always shows me measurements using the length of her fingers. Problem is we have different sized hands AND how do you quantify that measurement so that you can replicate it? I've tried SO many times to get teaspoon measurements for everything but can't say I've been entirely successful. This is the sole reason I haven't been able to make my food taste like my mom's food.</p>\n<p>Anyways, a girl can try right? Now back to her mind-BLASTING banana bread.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.meme.am/instances/55172211.jpg\" alt=\"Insert Russell Peters Gif Here\"></p>\n<p>Many of my friends are aware that I don't particularly have a sweet tooth. I mean sure I get cravings on occasion, however, banana bread has always been one of my favorite things, mainly because it's just the right level of sweetness. It has a strong taste of vanilla and of course banana! What could be better?!</p>\n<p>Once when I was having said cravings, I really really wanted to eat my mom's banana bread. So I decided to do my own take on her recipe, I know already going downhill, by adding zucchini and carrot. You know, hiding a little bit of healthy things in there to make you feel better about eating desserts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fk4kesqhxueed5q00j41f9gbjib2vgwo.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It actually came out pretty good, not quite mom level, but still pretty amazing.

I've been sick since Sunday, so I've been vegetating on my couch, watching a few too many chick flicks, all whilst drinking the world's supply of ginger chai <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/an-ode-to-chai/\">(hence my caffeine-fueled poem on Sunday which you should also totally read and appreciate)</a>.</p>\n<p>So, let's get to it!</p>\n<p>As the self-designated baker for my friend group, I've been baking birthday cakes for pretty much everyone. I've been trying to tailor each cake to something either they've specifically requested or what I think they would enjoy. This cake in particular was for one of my friends who loves whiskey. Her only requirement was that, and I quote, &quot;I do not kill her.&quot; I took it as a challenge in that I was going to put as much alcohol as possible in the cake while retaining its ability to taste good.</p>\n<p>Three things happened with this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I made a deliciously boozy cake</li>\n<li>I finished a LOT of the whiskey bottle I bought for this very specific purpose.</li>\n<li>I ended up getting fairly tipsy after a few batter taste tests</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>I also feel like I should include a warning: raw batter means raw eggs which also means the potential for salmonella. So be careful not to eat spoonfuls of your cake batter! That could get you very sick. Enjoy responsibly ;)</em></p>\n<p>Honestly, I'd say it was a completely successful experience. I totally recommend making boozy desserts to everyone (of legal age of course). :P Just don't expect to be productive after you put the cake in the oven. I had absolutely no attention span once I set that cake to bake. I ended up making one GIANT cake for my friend, another little one for the rest of us to enjoy on our own, and a few cupcakes for my coworkers to enjoy. I kid you not, I was swarmed and the cupcakes were gone within 20 minutes of me sending an email announcing the arrival of whiskey cupcakes. I'm now officially known as the dessert lady at work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zh4hcqy50kwhftm3na4bh6oy0944s31z.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Chocolate Whiskey Cake</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to increase/decrease the amount of whiskey according to your taste/tolerance.

Otherwise the eggs will cook when you add the coffee to it. Set your oven to preheat at 350 degrees.</p>\n        <p>Whisk the eggs, whiskey, buttermilk, and oil together in one bowl. Once the coffee is chilled, whisk that in as well.</p>\n        <p>In a separate bowl, stir the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together. Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with all the dry ingredients. Make sure to keep stirring while you pour.</p>\n        <p>Whisk until smooth. Taste to make sure the whiskey level is right. If not add more whiskey/flour accordingly.</p>\n        <p>Spray your cake pan (or place cupcake liners in your cupcake pan if you're making cupcakes) and pour in the batter. Set your timer for about 25-30 minutes (or 18-21 minutes for cupcakes) and wait! Poke the cake with a fork or toothpick (something that can reach fairly deep inside the cake). If it comes out clean, you're done! Cool the cake in the pan for 15 minutes, frost and devour!</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I did get lazy when it came to the frosting and just bought some chocolate frosting from the store. I felt it might be a little TOO much if I spiked that too, so I just spread shit tons of frosting on top of the cake/cupcakes and ate it. I'd say that was the better choice! If you're going easy on the whiskey inside the cake itself (or in the words of my friend, &quot;are being a little bitch&quot;), then maybe you can spike the frosting. Otherwise you've got enough alcohol in there to get the deed done.</p>\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-2.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-3.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-10.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-15.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-9.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-11.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-12.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-13.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Yes.

Enjoy :P</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3\">\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" wmode=\"Opaque\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WRu_-9MBpd4?wmode=transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>And no, in case you were wondering... I didn't spike these coffee cupcakes with cocaine.</p>\n<p>So, I'm not sure how many of you know this but coffee cake doesn't <em>ACTUALLY</em> have any coffee in it... I KNOW! I was just as disappointed as you are right now. Despite these cakes being a COMPLETE and utter lie, I love them down to the very last crumb.</p>\n<p>Deceit aside, this recipe was actually quite easy to make and also involved me having to make extra crumble topping to replace the amount I ate. I'd recommend doing the same for yourself :P hehe</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hvA6pTqEQm6XcEGxJR1QDpcf775kBo6WBVQX8RZ8ZJlF=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>NOTE: My crumble topping came out kind of clumpy but I think that was mainly because I got lazy and didn't add the ingredients one by one as described in the recipe. Instead, I decided to add everything at the same time and mix it. It doesn't really change the taste that much but I imagine the cinnamon sugar taste is more uniformly present if you make it right.</p>\n<p>Since I didn't really make a custom version of this recipe check out the recipe <a href=\"http://damndelicious.net/2014/03/24/coffee-cake-muffins/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Try the recipe out yourself and let me know what you think!!!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/56VFlyBdexLRsU0d083gX7yRl7EBSF3IzsF5c022mX7f=w998-h1496-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lFpv1SOuinbynxRRrxpXgQ8ZtffbXztTB9Uh_dz8Tn9D=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9Oi_tL571zkv8PxtTsvTsSfSrMFpGiotPu6odPNVdTpS=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aEbngOn4KZIveHj0kzWNvJS2garGhaPXtBFYA_ABrhtU=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Py-geJ6eWoOITUr4mZ-ZH8QUboRguSauLNU_iOrtXuND=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Py-geJ6eWoOITUr4mZ-ZH8QUboRguSauLNU_iOrtXuND=w1440-h960-no","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c280","name":"coffee","slug":"coffee"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c281","name":"cake","slug":"cake"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c282","name":"crumble","slug":"crumble"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29b","name":"cinnamon","slug":"cinnamon"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cake","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
