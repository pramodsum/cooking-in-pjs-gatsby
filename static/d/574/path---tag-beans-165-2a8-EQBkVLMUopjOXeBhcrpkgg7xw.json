I've been taking some time off between graduation and when I start work next month. So when one of my friends was also bored at home during her spring break, she decided to come over and join me in being a bum for a day. And what better food to have while lazing around then some Mexican loaded fries.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8616/16520615948_6bcba795e9_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Feel free to use sour cream instead of ranch or even add guacamole and other toppings you usually put on nachos! We didn't really want to leave the house and go grocery shopping, so we went with whatever was in the fridge. I usually make my own mexican seasoning, but feel free to replace the spices with a store bought seasoning if you want.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8585/16708189875_07f14b40ee_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Mexican Loaded Fries</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>This is a very rough recipe.
