YAY Post #2 for the week! And that\ntoo, to celebrate one of the nerdiest holidays out there! STAR WARS DAY!\n\n\n\nAll the wonderful puns.\n\nAlso because this recipe is banana filled, I HAD the little song by the Minions\nfrom Despicable Me stuck in my head. So I figured I should share that\nadorableness and mental torture with you guys.\n\nAnyways... after being home sick for an entire week in what I consider my\npersonal version of solitary confinement, I hit a new level of insanity. I was\ndeprived of social interaction to such a point that I legit LOL'd at a Buzzfeed\narticle of ridiculous snapchats for a good 20 minutes. And by LOL'd I mean\ncurled over laughing so hard I could barely breathe. No Buzzfeed article is THAT\nfunny. I had such bad sinus pain that working on my computer for long periods of\ntime was pretty rough. So I decided rather than wallowing in my bed, I was going\nto make SOME productive use of my time... baking for you guys!\n\nI found this recipe on Pinterest a while back of Cream Cheese Filled Chocolate\nChip Banana Coffee Cake\n[http://www.carlsbadcravings.com/cream-cheese-stuffed-chocolate-chip-banana-coffee-cake-recipe/]\n. I do want to preface my recipe with this:\n\n 1. I didn't some of the ingredients so this is my altered version for lazy\n    bakers :)\n 2. I also don't have a bundt cake pan, so mine didn't come out as gorgeous\n    looking as this but there is one thing I CAN guarantee, which is that they\n    came out DELICIOUS. Probably one of my favorite desserts I've ever made,\n    next to Tiramisu and my mom's Mush Cake.\n 3. I didn't have brown sugar and didn't want to bother making a second grocery\n    store trip for that so I just didn't bother making the streusel topping that\n    was in the original recipe. I can only imagine how much more mind blowing it\n    would have been had I added the streusel, maybe you can make yours with it\n    and let me know!\n\n\n\nOver the last few weeks I've been trying to figure out where in my new apartment\nI can do my food photography to optimize the natural light coming from my\nwindows. In my old apartment it was extremely easy, I had giant sliding doors\nwhich brought in ALL the light and shown over pretty much my entire living room;\nand if that wasn't enough then I could go out onto my balcony and take the\nphotos there! It was perfect. This week I discovered that if I angle one of my\nside tables properly and place the dish inside it, the light reflects off the\nwalls of the table perfectly onto the the food and really brings out all the\ndetails in the food! I HAD FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT! Although this weird\npositioning did lead to some old people back pain for me because of the weird\npositions that I laid in on the floor to get these photos. Such is the pain for\nbeauty.\n\n\n\nI mean just look at it...\n\nThis is one recipe I would HIGHLY recommend you try, whether it be my\ninterpretation or the original recipe itself. It was delicious and my coworkers\nand friends LOVED it.\n\n\n\nChocolate Chip Banana Cheesecake Coffee Cake \nIf you don't have over-ripe bananas, then Carlsbad Cravings gave a great\nsuggestion of sticking them in the oven at 325 F degrees until they're dark on\nthe outside and soft to the touch.\n\nIngredients:\nBanana Coffee Cake\n2 1/4 cups all purpose flour\n 1 1/4 tsp baking powder\n 1 1/4 tsp baking soda\n 1 tsp salt\n 2 tsp cinnamon\n 1/2 cup butter, softened\n 1 1/2 cup sugar\n 2 large eggs\n 4 large bananas, over-ripe and mashed\n 1 tbsp vanilla extract\n 1 1/4 cups non-fat plain yogurt (or greek yogurt)\n 3/4 cup chocolate chips\n Cheesecake filling\n16 oz cream cheese, softened\n 1/2 cup reserved batter (from banana coffee cake above)\n 1/2 cup sugar\n 2 tsp vanilla extract\n Directions:\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F and spray your pan with nonstick cooking spray and\nflour the inside of your pan.\n\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and\ncinnamon. Set aside.\n\nUsing a hand mixer, beat the butter and sugar together until fluffy. Add the\neggs in one at a time and beat until blended. Mix in the vanilla and bananas\nuntil just combined.\n\nGradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the\nyogurt. Beat until just combined. Measure out 1/2 cup of batter and keep aside\nfor the cheesecake filling. Stir in the chocolate chips into the remaining\nbatter and keep aside. Measure out about 1 cup of the batter with chocolate\nchips and keep aside to layer on top of the cheesecake filling. Pour the\nremaining batter into your pan.\n\nIn a separate bowl, mix together the 1/2 cup batter you set aside earlier with\nthe rest of the cheesecake filling ingredients on high speed until smooth and\ncreamy.\n\nSpread the cheesecake filling on top of the current layer batter in the pan.\nIt's okay if it sinks in a bit, this cake is much more moist than the original\nrecipe so the cheesecake layer is more variable in size. Pour the top layer of\nbatter on top of the cheesecake filling. If you made a streusel, now is the time\nto sprinkle it on top.\n\nBake for 55-60 minutes at 350 degrees F or until toothpick inserted comes out\nclean (ignoring the melted chocolate chips and any possible cream cheese that\nstill may not be solid). Let it cool and enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n![] (https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/opdcb8ciiq9ib1qbz8nfbz84gtjvanxz.jpg)","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/l2l9lmho8q088kczuewl9ll8ec4uz2b8.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c291","name":"banana","slug":"banana"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c280","name":"coffee","slug":"coffee"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c281","name":"cake","slug":"cake"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c253","name":"cupcakes","slug":"cupcakes"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c272","name":"cheesecake","slug":"cheesecake"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c32b","name":"chocolate chips","slug":"chocolate-chips"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c32c","name":"experiments","slug":"experiments"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c32d","name":"minions","slug":"minions"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c32e","name":"star wars","slug":"star-wars"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c32f","name":"sick days","slug":"sick-days"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"minions","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
