Sorry for the brief and awkward hiatus; it was certainly\nnot our intention, and won't be happening again! Sumu was moving, and I was\nletting law school rain on my parade. But we're back now!\n\n\n\nSumu's all settled into her new apartment in the city, and while law school is\nstill kicking my ass, I've decided to chill out. Law school itself was never the\npoint, and forgetting that is the number one cause of stress for me.\n\nSo, we're kicking off our triumphant return with a throwback recipe. When I got\nto California to visit Sumu, we made fresh rolls. I'll be honest and say that I\ndon't know the difference between a spring roll and a fresh roll. What I do know\nis that fresh rolls, full of bright, delicious veggies and sauces, feel like\nspring time to me.\n\n\n\nThis recipe is easily customizable, for which reason there are no specific\nquantities in the recipe. Do what your heart tells you. Go with your gut. Feel\nout your local grocer and figure out what you can get in what quantities.\n\nSpring is finally here, and while spring break has long since passed, these\nrolls will pretty much always be in season.\n\nSpring Rolls\nThese are the best way to deliver a quick, one two punch of veggies to yo' bod.\nYour mouth and your stomach deserve this meal. This is a pretty sexy recipe,\nwith all the crisp, fresh veggies, the sharp kick from the sriracha and the\nsilky sweetness of hoisin, with some big fresh basil leaves bringing it full\ncircle...I'm drooling just thinking about it! \n\nYield: negotiable\n\nTotal Time:  45 minutes\n\nIngredients:\nComponent 1\nRice paper sheets. Can be found at Asian groceries\n Fresh basil leavesBok choyCarrotsCilantroBeetsBean sproutsHoisin SauceSriracha\nSauceTofuAlfalfa sprouts\n Directions:\n\n1.) Prepare your vegetables. Slice your carrots into matchsticks, steam your bok\nchoy, saute the beets, cook your tofu how you like (we did fried tofu sauted in\nbarbecue sauce) and rinse your bean sprouts, before arranging everything in\nbowls around your workstation.\n\n\n2.) Set a shallow plate full of hot water beside you, and take out a rice paper\nsheet. Dip it into the water for ten seconds, and then lay it out on a cutting\nboard.\n\n\n3.) Layer your veggies and tofu in a mound in the middle of the sheet, then\ndrizzle sauces over it. Fold the two sides over, then roll smoothly from top to\nbottom.\n\n\n4.) Enjoy. Delicious!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/7d95dkz95g5gdrlfsv8xdqd6bp2yxbic.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f3","name":"spring break","slug":"spring-break"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c30e","name":"spring rolls","slug":"spring-rolls"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c30f","name":"fresh rolls","slug":"fresh-rolls"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c310","name":"rice paper","slug":"rice-paper"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c311","name":"basil","slug":"basil"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c269","name":"sriracha","slug":"sriracha"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"rice-paper","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
