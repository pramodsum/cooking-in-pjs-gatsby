We had a grand plan to make eight different kinds of tacos, with a wild assortment of toppings, for all the people we knew. We invited friends, looked up taco recipes with abandon, and prepared our stomachs by eating as much avocado as possible. Then gradually, all our friends realized they had lives, and we had contemplated the plan for so long that it no longer seemed appealing. In the manner of gifts that you were supposed to “grow into,” something that seemed so exciting when we first considered it lost all appeal with lengthy consideration. </p>\n<p> Suddenly, taco day was a chore, something we needed to do – and if you ask either of our mothers, they will tell you that we rarely do those things. </p>  \n<p> So we shoved the plan to the back of the closet, along with “The Scarlet Letter” (which I received when I was only nine) and other childhood detritus. We adopted a new plan: lettuce wraps. Lettuce wraps, we reasoned, are healthier than traditional tacos – there are fewer carbs, or grains, or something that we know we’re supposed to avoid eating in excess. </p> \n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8545/15649695779_61aac68719_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p> We made Asian style lettuce wraps with egg fried noodles, vegetables cooked in soy sauce, and thai-inspired peanut sauce. </p> \n<p> To make the noodles, just make regular noodles according to the package instructions. Drain them, rinse them slightly in cold water, then cooking them in sesame oil on the stove until they’re hot all the way through. Crack eggs right on to noodles and stir until fully cooked, and voila! </p>  \n<p> For the vegetables, just toss them in soy sauce, a little rice vinegar, and salt and pepper, and then stir fry them until they’re ready. </p>\n<p> And for the peanut sauce, mix a half cup of creamy peanut butter with a tablespoon of rice vinegar, and about a half cup of soy sauce in a bowl. Then, in a pan, put about two tablespoons of sesame oil. Cook about a half cup of diced onions until fragrant and translucent, and add chili flakes to your taste. Once your chili flakes are fully incorporated, add your mixture of peanut butter, soy sauce, and vinegar and cook until heated through. </p>\n<p> We made Mexican style lettuce wraps with homemade salsa, sweet potatoes diced and pan roasted with taco seasonings, and mushrooms. </p>  \n<p> For this recipe, you can pretty much make any sort of salsa you like – feel free to experiment! For the sweet potatoes, just dice and cook in a pan until slightly crispy, and add taco seasoning like there’s no tomorrow. Trust us; you cannot have enough taco seasoning. </p>   \n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5611/15811854346_887e2574e5_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7524/15215525994_155fdec421_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8638/15650656340_36a8b87812_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p> Once we were done cooking, we set all our toppings out alongside the washed and dried lettuce leaves, and sat right down on the floor and stuffed our faces. </p>\n<p> It. Was. Awesome. </p>\n","title":"Is \"butter\" a carb?","slug":"is-butter-a-carb","published_at":"17 November, 2014","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8545/15649695779_61aac68719_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c237","slug":"lettuce-wraps"}]},"next":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7390/16401090985_f2b567095e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>One of the coolest thing about restaurants and coffee shops that open franchises internationally is that they tend to adapt their menu to the tastes of the country the store is in. For example, McDonald's in India actually has completely vegetarian options. Due to the <strong>large</strong> population of vegetarians in India, McDonald's has 2 segregated kitchens for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. In addition, they don't serve any beef items, in contrast to the McDonald's in the US, which is primarily beef burgers. Honestly, I love McDonald's in India! They've managed to merge Indian flavors into simple American burgers and come out with amazing dishes such as the McSpicy Paneer and McAloo Tiki Burger. If you haven't yet, you should definitely try the McSpicy Paneer Burger, it's my favorite! :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7447/16213447308_f042572573_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>My cousin recently had a major craving for Mexican food. The only problem is that we're in India and the Mexican food available doesn't taste quite the same nor as authentic. In order to quench our cravings, we even tried going to Taco Bell, which has a new item called the Paneer Tikka Masala Burrito! Unfortunately the menu had been too Indianized and no longer tasted Mexican. While this style of Taco Bell is very popular with people in India, it doesn't quite measure up to the Taco Bell we have in the US.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p240x240/10500572_10153058890499813_8118498097049613786_n.jpg?oh=045ce9ccadee439cd72f5918fcb7bb3e&amp;oe=55583775&amp;__gda__=1431596238_63eebcd5fe7f4c135a000227d439d70b\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Our best bet was to figure out how to make it our selves. Unfortunately we did run into a few bumps along the road:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is a lot harder to find iceberg lettuce in Bangalore than originally suspected. Iceberg lettuce isn't really in any kind of Indian food therefore only available at some special markets rather than on every street vegetable cart.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7448/16375097256_ab5794a54c_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Many people tend to substitute dahi for sour cream out of convenience, however, this doesn't have quite the same taste. Conveniently, we found a fairly easy <a href=\"http://www.tarladalal.com/Sour-Cream-(--Wraps-and-Rolls)-32623r\">recipe</a> on how to make our own homemade sour cream! <a href=\"http://www.tarladalal.com\">Tarla Dalal</a> to the rescue!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8601/16400164382_73d99cfb83_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Making the refried beans for the tacos ended up being extremely time consuming. If I had been in the US, I could have just bought a can of beans, cooked them with some cumin and cayene pepper and been done with it. I completely took for granted the preparation needed to make refried beans. First you needed to soak and cook the beans until they were soft, and then cook them in a pan with the appropriate seasoning. This took much longer than I had originally expected.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7400/15778603364_95408ed417_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We realized even making tortillas by hand wouldn't be so bad. Every morning, the cook at my grandparents house makes chapatis from scratch. Tortillas are esentially chapatis made from normal flour, not wheat. So my grandmother quickly whipped up a huge ball of dough for us to roll out and make into tortillas.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8588/16213679700_5c8738a6f2_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8606/16375090146_29515989da_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/16214852339_c9de429d99_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>No taco would be complete without salsa! We made 2 different types of salsa, corn with jalapenos and pico de gallo salsa. Both salsas are extremely easy to make. For the corn salsa, you just need to combine boiled sweet corn kernels, diced jalapenos, lemon juice, salt, and some cilantro. Mix it together and viola! You have salsa. Similarly, if you mix diced tomatoes and onions, minced garlic, cilantro, and lemon juice you get pico de gallo salsa. Both can be made very quickly and are fresh and delicious!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7299/16375094646_260f9aa406_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7444/15781043603_80df9ccbbd_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Surprisingly everything turned out really tasty and me and my cousin happily enjoyed delicious Mexican food for the next 2 days! :) My cousin loved it so much, she ate it for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner for the next 2 days.
