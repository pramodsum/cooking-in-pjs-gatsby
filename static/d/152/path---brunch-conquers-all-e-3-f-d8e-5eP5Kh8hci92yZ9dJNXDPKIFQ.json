For many years, breakfast on Saturday meant spending the entire morning alone on the couch, watching cartoons, dodging my mother's attempts to make me a productive citizen, and eating sugary cereal with abandon. Occasionally, we would have guests and my mother would cook some traditional Indian breakfast items - dosa, roti, upma, etc. - and we would have brunch. But these days were usually paired with pre and post cleaning and formal clothing, so while we loved the company, the whole situation was no bueno.</p>\n<p>It wasn't until I got to college that I really understood brunch. On our campus, Landon dining hall had the most amazing brunch you can imagine - everything from ice cream to omelettes to fresh fruit and berries was represented, and you could literally eat your heart out. In addition to that, we lived in close proximity to Golden Harvest, a small brunch area in Lansing that has a following that borders on obsessive. In East Lansing, brunch does not just pass you by, and from the minute I stepped into Landon, with a slight headache and stomache, craving grease and comfort food, I was a convert.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8656/16296194440_27d1c24829_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Brunch is neither breakfast nor lunch; it's an in between meal, and as such, doesn't have the conventions of the other two. You can enjoy some giggle juice with brunch. You can dip strawberries in chocolate and throw it on a waffle with sugar and it won't count as dessert. You can show up all smelly at your best friend's house at eleven o'clock, post late wake up call and workout, demand eggs, toast, and avocados, and call THAT brunch.</p>\n<p>You can wake up at eight AM and race to Golden Harvest, wait in line for over an hour and a half in the freezing cold, and earn your brunch. Or you can have a lie in at home and make yourself some waffles or toast and watch television, and it could be the most lovely brunch you'll ever have.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7560/15811864496_20a9e2f76e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Brunch is the most welcoming of the meals.</p>\n<p>Brunch is patient, brunch is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Brunch does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Brunch never fails.*</p>\n<p>Brunch is love, y'all. Show someone a little love and pan fry some potatoes and throw a poached egg on top. Give yourself a little treat and stick an overeasy fried egg in a sandwhich with some mixed greens and tomatoes. Use avocado liberally, and consider experimenting with sriracha and truffle oil. Kale and white sugar are both invited to this party, because brunch does not discriminate.</p>\n<p>Let your creative juices and chocolate sauce flow; brunch is a meal without protocol or limitations, and you definitely deserve that business in your life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5612/15837068312_eeff7d20e1_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>*I took some creative licenses with Corinthians 13:4-8a.

For example, McDonald's in India actually has completely vegetarian options. Due to the <strong>large</strong> population of vegetarians in India, McDonald's has 2 segregated kitchens for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. In addition, they don't serve any beef items, in contrast to the McDonald's in the US, which is primarily beef burgers. Honestly, I love McDonald's in India! They've managed to merge Indian flavors into simple American burgers and come out with amazing dishes such as the McSpicy Paneer and McAloo Tiki Burger. If you haven't yet, you should definitely try the McSpicy Paneer Burger, it's my favorite! :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7447/16213447308_f042572573_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>My cousin recently had a major craving for Mexican food. The only problem is that we're in India and the Mexican food available doesn't taste quite the same nor as authentic. In order to quench our cravings, we even tried going to Taco Bell, which has a new item called the Paneer Tikka Masala Burrito! Unfortunately the menu had been too Indianized and no longer tasted Mexican. While this style of Taco Bell is very popular with people in India, it doesn't quite measure up to the Taco Bell we have in the US.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p240x240/10500572_10153058890499813_8118498097049613786_n.jpg?oh=045ce9ccadee439cd72f5918fcb7bb3e&amp;oe=55583775&amp;__gda__=1431596238_63eebcd5fe7f4c135a000227d439d70b\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Our best bet was to figure out how to make it our selves. Unfortunately we did run into a few bumps along the road:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is a lot harder to find iceberg lettuce in Bangalore than originally suspected. Iceberg lettuce isn't really in any kind of Indian food therefore only available at some special markets rather than on every street vegetable cart.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7448/16375097256_ab5794a54c_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Many people tend to substitute dahi for sour cream out of convenience, however, this doesn't have quite the same taste. Conveniently, we found a fairly easy <a href=\"http://www.tarladalal.com/Sour-Cream-(--Wraps-and-Rolls)-32623r\">recipe</a> on how to make our own homemade sour cream! <a href=\"http://www.tarladalal.com\">Tarla Dalal</a> to the rescue!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8601/16400164382_73d99cfb83_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Making the refried beans for the tacos ended up being extremely time consuming. If I had been in the US, I could have just bought a can of beans, cooked them with some cumin and cayene pepper and been done with it. I completely took for granted the preparation needed to make refried beans. First you needed to soak and cook the beans until they were soft, and then cook them in a pan with the appropriate seasoning. This took much longer than I had originally expected.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7400/15778603364_95408ed417_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We realized even making tortillas by hand wouldn't be so bad. Every morning, the cook at my grandparents house makes chapatis from scratch. Tortillas are esentially chapatis made from normal flour, not wheat. So my grandmother quickly whipped up a huge ball of dough for us to roll out and make into tortillas.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8588/16213679700_5c8738a6f2_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8606/16375090146_29515989da_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/16214852339_c9de429d99_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>No taco would be complete without salsa! We made 2 different types of salsa, corn with jalapenos and pico de gallo salsa. Both salsas are extremely easy to make. For the corn salsa, you just need to combine boiled sweet corn kernels, diced jalapenos, lemon juice, salt, and some cilantro. Mix it together and viola! You have salsa. Similarly, if you mix diced tomatoes and onions, minced garlic, cilantro, and lemon juice you get pico de gallo salsa. Both can be made very quickly and are fresh and delicious!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7299/16375094646_260f9aa406_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7444/15781043603_80df9ccbbd_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Surprisingly everything turned out really tasty and me and my cousin happily enjoyed delicious Mexican food for the next 2 days! :) My cousin loved it so much, she ate it for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner for the next 2 days.

First off, there's no turkey. Secondly, <a href=\"http://uppukhara.com\">my mom</a> makes a glorious display of Thanksgiving inspired Indian dishes! From masala dosa with cranberry chutney to stuffing upma (or bread upit) and spicy herb yams, we always enjoy a large variety of dishes. The only thing I personally demand every year is pumpkin pie! I love pumpkin pie. The wonderful blend of spices and sweet, and yet it's not that sweet; perfect for someone without a strong sweet tooth!</p>\n<p>What do you get when you combine two of my favorite desserts in the world, pumpkin pie and tiramisu? Basically, it's one of the greatest desserts ever created by man. I was a little skeptical about how well this combination of flavors would be received by all of our thanksgiving guests, but it was a hit. Even without adding the usual brandy, rum, or amaretto, everyone loved the wonderful blend of flavors.</p>\n<p>One warning I have about this recipe is that you should be careful in blending the cornstarch mixture into the pumpkin creme. If this step is not done properly, you will have cornstarch lumps in your tiramisu and that is just gross.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7450/16296261980_1c317311c8_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7575/15837079972_56f32edc3e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7532/15650090328_71473d0b07_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Pumpkin Tiramisu</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Recipe modified from  http://www.nytimes.com/projects/well/vegetarian-recipes/#recipe/pumpkin-tiramisu</em></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n        <h4>Pumpkin Creme</h4>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">⅓ cup cornstarch</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ cup water</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ cup milk</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ cup maple syrup</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ teaspoon allspice</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ teaspoon cinnamon</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ teaspoon nutmeg</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">½ teaspoon salt</li>\n        <h4>Tiramisu</h4>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 pot black coffee</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 package lady finger biscuits</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">16oz mascarpone cheese</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">ground chocolate for garnishing</li>\n      </div>\n    <!-- </div> -->\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p><strong>To make the Pumpkin Creme:</strong> In a small bowl, thoroughly mix cornstarch and water with a whisk or fork until there are <strong>NO  LUMPS</strong> and set aside. In a medium saucepan, whisk together milk, pumpkin puree, maple syrup, spices and salt, and heat over medium heat until it just begins to boil, about 5 minutes. Slowly drizzle cornstarch mixture into the saucepan, whisking continuously. Cook until the mixture becomes very thick, about 5 minutes, whisking frequently. Pour the creme into a bowl and let cool about 15 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap so that the plastic wrap is touching the top of the creme. Refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.</p><p><strong>To assemble:</strong> Soak each lady finger biscuit in coffee for a few seconds and quickly place in a large dish. Spread a layer of Pumpkin Creme on top. Repeat this process for as many layers fill up the dish or all the components run out. Alternate spreading a layer of Pumpkin Creme and mascarpone cheese between layers of biscuit.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8632/16297442359_be80bb9139_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"The Love Child of Pumpkin Pie and Tiramisu","slug":"the-love-child-of-pumpkin-pie-and-tiramisu","published_at":"27 February, 2015","feature_image":"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7398/16297798177_79beaa8237_o.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c238","slug":"tiramisu"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c240","slug":"pumpkin"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c241","slug":"thanksgiving"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c24b","slug":"pumpkin-pie"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","slug":"desserts"}]}}}
