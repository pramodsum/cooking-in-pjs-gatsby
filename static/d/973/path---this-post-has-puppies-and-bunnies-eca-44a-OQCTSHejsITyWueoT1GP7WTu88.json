There are so many different varieties of food I love making and it makes no sense for me to maintain a kitchen stocked with ALL the ingredients for whenever I'd want to make any of these things. Usually when I post recipes, I try to use the ingredients I already have, can make substitutes, or keep the grocery shopping to a minimum. #LivinLaVidaLazy</p>\n<p>I didn't have some of the specific ingredients so I used a bunch of more commonly available substitutes and tasted it every now and then if I needed to make adjustments. My recipe is roughly based on a recipe from <a href=\"http://www.gimmesomeoven.com/homemade-bbq-sauce-recipe/\">Gimme Some Oven</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.foodrenegade.com/homemade-worcesterschire-sauce/\">Food Renegade</a>. However, doubt me as you will, I had my friend who's grown up in Texas taste test my sauce and he loved it. You don't mess with Texans and their BBQ sauce... they know their sauce. He did give me one suggestion that I'll pass along to you guys, which was to add Liquid Smoke. Personally I have no idea what that is, but apparently it is life changing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/q2bizza1yo67mf7ke4n847seddnm2uf4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/w9jluoe11rs0l2tern4fe91qkw8mnlzj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Homemade BBQ Sauce</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup molasses</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup mustard</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup red wine (or apple cider vinegar)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp paprika</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp garlic powder</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp freshly ground garlic</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">salt to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">a few pinches of cayenne pepper to taste</li>\n          <h4>Tomato Sauce + Paste</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">3 Roma tomatoes, pureed</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup ketchup (or puree 1 more tomato with some salt)</li>\n          <h4>\"Worcestershire\" Sauce</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup red wine (or apple cider vinegar)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tbsp molasses</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tbsp tamarind paste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Juice of 1 lime</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 tsp ground clove</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 tsp garlic</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 tsp chili powder</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Whisk all the ingredients together in a saucepan over medium heat.

I used <a href=\"http://www.familyfreshmeals.com/2014/06/best-crockpot-bbq-chicken.html\">this post from Family Fresh Meals</a> to figure out how to actually cook the chicken and didn't bother adding the extra Italian dressing, Worcestershire Sauce, etc. Also in keeping with the #LivinLaVidaLazy theme, I didn't even bother buying buns for the chicken. I just devoured it on various types of crackers I had at home. Best thing about this sauce is that you can use it in SO many different ways. Not only did I use it for pulled chicken, but we coated some fried tofu with the sauce to take our fresh rolls to a whole new level.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/txb7aup0o1j84cpq3ihiexnvwev1qhha.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fioewthw07p9j1xq43a87jt6m61qgfjk.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ph5xt6ynrfqy9k96ey3envqni9s144p6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/9rqxf3dpvx4qrfmuuqcosdfr6sjjv3v2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/kqopbbjcm03630m09ngp3rwrz80cic29.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ra36zozb7as5vdbnv29dogkxx2kly1wg.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"Save a Horse...
