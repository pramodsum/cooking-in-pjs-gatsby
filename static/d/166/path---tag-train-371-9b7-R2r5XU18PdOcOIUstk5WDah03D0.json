One of my favorite bands, Train, partnered with a California winery to make a line of wines named after some of their most famous songs! What could be better than that!</p>\n<p>This was a great wine for me and my friends, especially because we all have different preferences when it comes to wine. I prefer a really deep spicy red, whereas most of my friends like drier whites or dessert wines. Surprisingly, this wine solved most of our dilemmas. Each glass is smooth, sweet and spicy, but doesn't lean too far in either direction. It has something for all shades of wine lovers! (Plus it doesn't hurt that it's under $10) It's a college wine lover's dream! :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8782/17033305629_16faa89701_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Drops of Jupiter is not even the only type of wine that the Save Me San Francisco Wine Co makes. They also make Calling All Angels, California 37, Bulletproof Picasso, Hella Fine, and Soul Sister.</p>\n<p>Just pour yourself a glass, blast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xf-Lesrkuc\">Drops of Jupiter</a>, and take a trip back to the 90's!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m33pmsMyUY1qflcm5o1_500.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8782/17033305629_16faa89701_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c242","name":"giggle juice","slug":"giggle-juice"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c247","name":"wine","slug":"wine"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c248","name":"drops of jupiter","slug":"drops-of-jupiter"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c249","name":"train","slug":"train"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c24a","name":"red wine","slug":"red-wine"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"train","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
