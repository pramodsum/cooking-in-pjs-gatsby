The ice cream maker bowl wouldn't\nfreeze, even after 48 hours in the freezer. And then the ice cream itself failed\nto freeze after eight hours in the freezer. It was still delicious, but\ndelicious with the consistency of soft serve, rather than hard ice cream.\n\n\n\nBasically, I made fro yo. With strawberries! Enjoy.\n\n\n\nTitle\nAt some point, ice cream became designated as a summer treat - and I say, down\nwith the discrimination! We should be free to have ice cream all year round!\nDon't let the ice cream fascists take away your fun. \n\nYield: I have no idea. A tupperware container full!\n\nTotal Time:  About one hour of active time, two days of waiting\n\nIngredients:\nIce Cream base\n2 Cans Full Fat Coconut Milk1 Tbls Maple Syrup\n 1 C Cashews\n 1 Tbls Cornstarch or Arrowroot Powder\n Excess Liquid From Jam (see below)\n Jam!\n1 C Strawberries\n 2 C Blueberries1/2 C 100% Fruit Juice (I used a berry blend)1 Tbls Maple Syrup1\nTbls Cornstarch or Arrowroot Powder\n Directions:\n\n1.) First things first, put your ice cream maker's bowl in the freezer, and\nchill your coconut milk in the fridge overnight before you start.\n\n\n2.) Put your strawberries, blueberries, juice, and maple syrup into a saucepan\nand let simmer. When the fruit is about halfway to being complete mush, move to\nstep 3.\n\n\n3.) Crack open your coconut milk and pour into the blender. Add the maple syrup,\nand carefully remove some of the juice that's in your saucepan, and add it as\nwell. This cuts down on simmering time for the jam, and adds color and flavor to\nthe ice cream! Blend.\n\n  \n4.) While the fruit continues to cook, take about 3/4 of the coconut milk you've\nblended up and put it in a container. Then add the arrowroot or cornstarch, and\nblend the remaining 1/4 until fully combined. Pour into container with the rest\nof the coconut milk base.\n\n  \n5.) Your fruit should be complete mush now - if there's any juice left, now is\nthe time to slowly pour it into the ice cream base, until there's only a couple\nof tablespoons of liquid in the saucepan with the fruit.\n\n\n6.) Carefully sprinkle the arrowroot or cornstarch onto the fruit, stirring\nvigorously to prevent clumping. Allow to cook an additional couple of minutes,\nuntil the mixture has thickened just a bit. Remove from heat, and pour into a\ncontainer.\n\n\n7.) Put the coconut milk base and jam into the fridge - both need to chill for a\nbit, at least twelve hours, ideally 24 or more.\n\n\n8.) Climb a tree, read a book, explore nature. Go to work? You do you, boo boo.\n\n\n9.) When all ingredients are thoroughly chilled, follow the directions on your\nice cream maker! When there are five - ten minutes left, add the jam, and allow\nto incorporate completely.\n\n\n10.) Eat ice cream in February. Don't let THE MAN tell you what to do.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/gcws27i9ca8jn5gkqd2j6osakirvt43d.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2df","name":"ice cream","slug":"ice-cream"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","name":"vegan","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","name":"sugarrush","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e0","name":"coconut milk","slug":"coconut-milk"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e1","name":"berries","slug":"berries"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e2","name":"summertime","slug":"summertime"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e3","name":"sweet treats","slug":"sweet-treats"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e4","name":"fight the power","slug":"fight-the-power"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e5","name":"i stand with planned parenthood","slug":"i-stand-with-planned-parenthood"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e6","name":"and black lives matter","slug":"and-black-lives-matter"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e7","name":"and native nations","slug":"and-native-nations"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e8","name":"power to the people","slug":"power-to-the-people"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"summertime","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
