YAY Post #2 for the week! And that too, to celebrate one of the nerdiest holidays out there!

So I figured I should share that adorableness and mental torture with you guys.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3\">\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" wmode=\"Opaque\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sFukyIIM1XI?wmode=transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>Anyways... after being home sick for an entire week in what I consider my personal version of solitary confinement, I hit a new level of insanity. I was deprived of social interaction to such a point that I legit LOL'd at a Buzzfeed article of ridiculous snapchats for a good 20 minutes. And by LOL'd I mean curled over laughing so hard I could barely breathe. No Buzzfeed article is THAT funny. I had such bad sinus pain that working on my computer for long periods of time was pretty rough. So I decided rather than wallowing in my bed, I was going to make SOME productive use of my time... baking for you guys!</p>\n<p>I found this recipe on Pinterest a while back of <a href=\"http://www.carlsbadcravings.com/cream-cheese-stuffed-chocolate-chip-banana-coffee-cake-recipe/\">Cream Cheese Filled Chocolate Chip Banana Coffee Cake</a>. I do want to preface my recipe with this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I didn't some of the ingredients so this is my altered version for lazy bakers :)</li>\n<li>I also don't have a bundt cake pan, so mine didn't come out as gorgeous looking as this but there is one thing I CAN guarantee, which is that they came out DELICIOUS. Probably one of my favorite desserts I've ever made, next to Tiramisu and my mom's Mush Cake.</li>\n<li>I didn't have brown sugar and didn't want to bother making a second grocery store trip for that so I just didn't bother making the streusel topping that was in the original recipe. I can only imagine how much more mind blowing it would have been had I added the streusel, maybe you can make yours with it and let me know!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/1tjouximy6nxjmeaomjqkrsd4i5ouqxi.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Over the last few weeks I've been trying to figure out where in my new apartment I can do my food photography to optimize the natural light coming from my windows. In my old apartment it was extremely easy, I had giant sliding doors which brought in ALL the light and shown over pretty much my entire living room; and if that wasn't enough then I could go out onto my balcony and take the photos there! It was perfect. This week I discovered that if I angle one of my side tables properly and place the dish inside it, the light reflects off the walls of the table perfectly onto the the food and really brings out all the details in the food! I HAD FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT! Although this weird positioning did lead to some old people back pain for me because of the weird positions that I laid in on the floor to get these photos. Such is the pain for beauty.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/l2l9lmho8q088kczuewl9ll8ec4uz2b8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I mean just look at it...</p>\n<p>This is one recipe I would HIGHLY recommend you try, whether it be my interpretation or the original recipe itself.

It kind of ended up working out for me because I took my camera and explored! I walked from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach and soaked in the gorgeous SoCal sun.</p>\n<p>In Santa Monica, I stopped at the Lobster for some AMAZING crab cake.

Of course I had to have ONE basic picture myself to commemorate the experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/z7gfp3dlql2f2wag911y4lvsznp2q06v.jpg\" alt=\"insert basic watermelon picture here\"></p>\n<p>Coachella is also a GREAT place for foodies. While you needed to be a VIP to get access to some of the tastiest and more exclusive food, there was plenty of delicious options to spare. Looking back at my food photos, I realize that I basically survived off fries. Just fries. And obviously watermelon, because it IS Coachella. But these fries were no ordinary fries my friends. They were all loaded with various toppings and delicious goodness.</p>\n<p>Veggie Monster Fries with lots of types of slaw and jalapeños!<br>\n<img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/z4ge00bngygbfezcdyv3x4gdsve5p72u.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Vegetarian Poutin Fries with cheese curds!<br>\n<img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/uyr9jkumf8n2a6mzue6bxdrimbfblro2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Crab Fries!

Shape into 26 cookies and set on a greased baking sheet - these cookies won't spread, so flatten them to the shape you want. Stick in the fridge, and preheat the oven to 350. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n6.) When the oven is ready, put your cookies in and set a timer for fifteen minutes.

While the cookies are baking, take out your coconut cream and flip it upside down. Open it, and there should be some liquid there. Pour that into a cup (it's delicious, and can be used in smoothies) and scoop out the cream into a separate bowl. Whip, then add the sugar and orange oil and whip some more. \n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n8.)

Personally if I were to remake these, I'd just use normal flour and make smaller size cinnamon buns. They're tiny anyways so we can splurge on the flour ;)</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think!!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/wd6yuffsgpi30wby34ow9ew6hmzb2wom.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/qulje72c2gd7qydbwogjmo9hzt0j9syj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/atopoadpbxnaqr76f2hxjft79n4c8wxe.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fze2l6asol2ik625i8v08jdbd4gj35lj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/wd6yuffsgpi30wby34ow9ew6hmzb2wom.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29b","name":"cinnamon","slug":"cinnamon"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c30f","name":"fresh rolls","slug":"fresh-rolls"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c37f","uuid":"eaed4c13-ea2f-4325-9310-725d55d2c0ea","title":"Scrambled","slug":"scrambled-tofu","published_at":"18 April, 2016","html":"<p>My brain feels scrambled.

Mix your marinade ingredients together, and add water if you need to so that it's not too thick. It should be roughly the consistency of gravy. \n</p><p> \n2.) Rip your tofu into bit sized chunks with forks or with your hands, and  mix the marinade into the tofu. Set the mixture in the fridge overnight. \n</p><p> \n3.) Chop your broccoli, kale, and mushrooms, and cook your veg - broccoli, then kale and mushrooms together. Be sure to add some salt and spices to the vegetables!\n</p><p> \n4.) When the vegetables are half cooked, create a space, and pour your tofu scramble in. Let it cook for a few minutes, 5-7 should be just enough. \n</p><p> \n5.)
