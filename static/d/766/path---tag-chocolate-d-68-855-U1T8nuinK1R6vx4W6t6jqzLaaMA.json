I HAD to include the video for this song because 1) Katrina Kaif looks gorgeous and 2) it's so damn catchy that it's become my new obsession.</p>\n<p>For this birthday cake, I thought it'd be fun to embody one of a classic drink in the form of a cake.</p>\n<h1 id=\"anoldfashionedcake\">An Old Fashioned Cake</h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/qnuzhxf19zdc4qe7tz9qhjelervhkxc4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Not to toot my own horn, but I think this cake may have been the greatest one I've made so far. To be fair... I didn't make the actual cake from scratch. I had initially and then had a few friends taste it because I was unsure. That batch was probably the worst cakes I have ever made in my entire life.... There was absolutely no way I could bring that to my friend's birthday celebration. At that point, I was running short on time so I bought some standard Duncan Hines chocolate cake mixes and made 2 small round cakes according to package instructions.</p>\n<p>Here's where the fun and experimentation started!</p>\n<p>An old fashioned is a fairly simple drink according to <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/recipes/a3880/old-fashioned-drink-recipe/\">Esquire Magazine</a>:<br>\n1 Sugar Cube<br>\n3 dashes of Angostura Bitters<br>\n1 L Club Soda<br>\n2 oz. Rye Whiskey</p>\n<p>Some people tend to garnish their drinks with orange peels and cherries to add some flair to their drink. The hard core Don Drapers will stick to their stiff drinks... but this is a cake so I had some fun with it.</p>\n<p>I decided there would be 3 components to this cake outside the base chocolate cake layers and the frosting on top.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/8filn60lmi2pezfhyyuhnwyd1vdfg6s6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"whiskeysoakedcherries\">Whiskey Soaked Cherries</h1>\n<p>This is the easiest part of the entire cake. Just stick a bunch of cherries in a jar and fill it with the whiskey/bourbon/etc of your choice. I used Jack Daniels for everything in this cake because that's what we had at home. By the time you're done with the rest of the cake, these cherries will be nice and boozy to stick on garnish the top!</p>\n<h1 id=\"candiedorangepeels\">Candied Orange Peels</h1>\n<p>This part I wasn't really creative on. I followed the <a href=\"http://bakingthegoods.com/2013/12/06/drinking-buddies-recipe-whiskey-chocolate-cake-whisky-buttercream-frosting/\">instructions in this recipe</a>! It's actually fairly painless and you can do it while you're doing the rest of the cake prep and ganache prep.</p>\n<h1 id=\"nutellawhiskeyganachefilling\">Nutella Whiskey Ganache Filling</h1>\n<p>My ganache filling ended up being a hodge podge of a few recipes I've both made before and found on the internets.</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Nutella Whiskey Ganache</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/2 cup nutella</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 can sweetened condensed milk</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Whiskey to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Confectioners sugar to thicken  if needed</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Combine the ingredients on the stove on low heat until well mixed. Feel free to add as much whiskey as you want based on how boozy you want the ganache to be. Allow the ganache to cool. If the ganache is still too thin, add some confectioner's sugar until it thickens.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Assembling this cake was pretty easy. Place a layer of cake on the plate and poke holes in it with the back of a wooden spoon. Pour ganache over until the holes are filled and a layer of ganache exists over the cake. Stack the other layer of cake on top and also poke holes in this layer. Pour just enough ganache over this layer to fill the holes. Cover the cake with your favorite vanilla/plain frosting. I prefer Duncan Hines Cream Cheese frosting but that's up to you what kind of frosting you want! Top the cake with some whiskey cherries, candied orange peels, and even some chocolate or orange peel shavings if you want.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/mufzx61sqambx3kf7gx6clftip5sozso.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/kjnx23pun0ckfiegog2ujetcd4igscbi.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/qnuzhxf19zdc4qe7tz9qhjelervhkxc4.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c28b","name":"chocolate","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c8","name":"whiskey","slug":"whiskey"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c242","name":"giggle juice","slug":"giggle-juice"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c9","name":"birthday","slug":"birthday"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c337","name":"anerica","slug":"anerica"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c338","name":"old fashioned","slug":"old-fashioned"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c339","name":"orange","slug":"orange"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c33a","name":"cherry","slug":"cherry"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c36a","uuid":"a5004992-c2ed-4f4b-beac-59baa322db49","title":"Everyone needs a 'Lil Dicky' in their life","url":"https://cookinginpjs.herokuapp.com/everyone-needs-a-lil-dicky-in-their-life/","published_at":"19 July, 2016","html":"<p>So recently it was one of my closest friend's, whom we lovingly call Lil Dicky, birthdays.

I was not aware that this was an <em>ACTUAL</em> holiday but I'm not gonna complain. I firmly believe that everyday should be National Chocolate Cake Day! But hey, I'll take one day a year.</p>\n<p>Second, it's your lucky week! You get TWO whole posts from me! I've been sick since Sunday, so I've been vegetating on my couch, watching a few too many chick flicks, all whilst drinking the world's supply of ginger chai <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/an-ode-to-chai/\">(hence my caffeine-fueled poem on Sunday which you should also totally read and appreciate)</a>.</p>\n<p>So, let's get to it!</p>\n<p>As the self-designated baker for my friend group, I've been baking birthday cakes for pretty much everyone. I've been trying to tailor each cake to something either they've specifically requested or what I think they would enjoy. This cake in particular was for one of my friends who loves whiskey. Her only requirement was that, and I quote, &quot;I do not kill her.&quot; I took it as a challenge in that I was going to put as much alcohol as possible in the cake while retaining its ability to taste good.</p>\n<p>Three things happened with this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I made a deliciously boozy cake</li>\n<li>I finished a LOT of the whiskey bottle I bought for this very specific purpose.</li>\n<li>I ended up getting fairly tipsy after a few batter taste tests</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>I also feel like I should include a warning: raw batter means raw eggs which also means the potential for salmonella. So be careful not to eat spoonfuls of your cake batter! That could get you very sick. Enjoy responsibly ;)</em></p>\n<p>Honestly, I'd say it was a completely successful experience. I totally recommend making boozy desserts to everyone (of legal age of course). :P Just don't expect to be productive after you put the cake in the oven. I had absolutely no attention span once I set that cake to bake. I ended up making one GIANT cake for my friend, another little one for the rest of us to enjoy on our own, and a few cupcakes for my coworkers to enjoy. I kid you not, I was swarmed and the cupcakes were gone within 20 minutes of me sending an email announcing the arrival of whiskey cupcakes. I'm now officially known as the dessert lady at work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zh4hcqy50kwhftm3na4bh6oy0944s31z.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Chocolate Whiskey Cake</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to increase/decrease the amount of whiskey according to your taste/tolerance.

Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with all the dry ingredients. Make sure to keep stirring while you pour.</p>\n        <p>Whisk until smooth. Taste to make sure the whiskey level is right. If not add more whiskey/flour accordingly.</p>\n        <p>Spray your cake pan (or place cupcake liners in your cupcake pan if you're making cupcakes) and pour in the batter. Set your timer for about 25-30 minutes (or 18-21 minutes for cupcakes) and wait! Poke the cake with a fork or toothpick (something that can reach fairly deep inside the cake). If it comes out clean, you're done! Cool the cake in the pan for 15 minutes, frost and devour!</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I did get lazy when it came to the frosting and just bought some chocolate frosting from the store. I felt it might be a little TOO much if I spiked that too, so I just spread shit tons of frosting on top of the cake/cupcakes and ate it. I'd say that was the better choice! If you're going easy on the whiskey inside the cake itself (or in the words of my friend, &quot;are being a little bitch&quot;), then maybe you can spike the frosting. Otherwise you've got enough alcohol in there to get the deed done.</p>\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-2.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-3.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-10.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-15.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-9.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-11.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-12.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-13.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Yes.

Thankfully after making 3-4 batches of these oatmeal bars I finished 1 bowl, but I ended up making some dark chocolate fruit and nut clusters as well (post coming soon).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sGP7DG-ogISOqpn5cRBPGfuyssXcg4RgvQrrHS9UhVFMELUH4_UZmo210YRzTkLpdPGWv5x2ZFM4jExGZQWfocYpQGZdZiHKQEKg_pqMyhN-So95F9-dypl_FJpWELhBfs86l7Rrk3qWGPTpStQ2mG0CXPGYFOdcO6eQmaDVSSRKcHBhyWGXjPdALsaiblUo92stdgRYxOSGCk7Mti2VVkQekoIIf1z_qxwYD63gjXrQUKzap7dodLYFyONtcohBmOK4iEFcCs5Y3Wtl9J9J8dw6uZzJ1qLmDI_OT7Pt_vGAgDYXeQC-C_jAD4BBiIS4jJUAr-Auuh75uxjDm6RsGFl211_fuQ91zKMO-DMCW_i3H6tQHGCUpGDbuFNID-Tf5BZDIAiCIom05iwRRAt9I5CU6tx_e_Ppjj7dBAiKOLOCQA96jWOUdFkqw5ClRrZ7xvmdX9OR_Odhx-04FI6_Ugi9BPUFpx24NvgIuaOiQc6efIcEYOwsOWtycdKE1xhIjAo613H3h9zv3EUO09L8M1DSPgixNHUwMZwr6aOdOl1r=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In all honesty, these cookie bars were SO much better than those chocolate clusters (as scrumptious as those look). The crumbly-ness and chocolatey-ness of these bars complemented each other perfectly. I've actually saved all the extra crumbles to top ice scream sundaes. Think about how delicious that would be!!! Now that you're officially drooling thinking about that, here's the recipe.</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie Bars</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">3 cups granola (or oats)</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup butter, melted</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 cups chocolate chips</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 cups flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1½ cups brown sugar</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp baking soda</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1½ tbsp vanilla</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 eggs</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray.</p>\n        <p>Add everything but the chocolate chips into a bowl and mix until just combined. I don't have a standing mixer or this would have been much easier and less messier. Stir in the chocolate chips.</p>\n        <p>Spread the batter into the baking dish. Bake for 25 minutes or until a tester comes out with just a few moist crumbs. Bars should look slightly underdone. Let cool 1 hour before cutting into bars. (But let's be honest here... I couldn't wait more than 10 minutes)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Because the granola I used wasn't very sweet it didn't overly sweeten the bars either, which was something I preferred. Similarly, using brown sugar instead of normal granular sugar kept the bars less sweet. Make sure not to overcook the bars or they won't be as gloriously crumbly!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uQrAyDivSMbcmNtvHNBFu_QdSkQPcf2sZgjnRyK68wk8V9SYj8q2L4Zjl6gG2qsOnHao_a5nTKX9qm7T76p6eGY5ZaLABI6SBgCxTsdh3grdS_IvVj2xMRqvp7A5oX8ZksEX80b_6stHwWjiPs-kz014FANeFRWv8x8icGwd0wJ5w7s_hWQnEAEwUiEEX91_Uxb0SxlNsXJTbhlCoCqh_HyxKUJRmoR5LQ9LcTF87CSBz2rFfQHLlgZC1qk61bVwoSy_YnlFKVR5Izcx3yPmu2vp0zx183nfiNmZdKbJ60mc8Jm_jlmk1Z-KtqmdAVSxaFZ6sqtPOsggjwXEZIH0hFHZOPhgX6zfyzH_vLQ0tWPQa1OUAmMOWp_zm3-3umJ1tGTifgjs0RlrqxiuTWfjfSr8POYttNJSh7m1DzHRT5prbidF1SQIYAMJfzUIKJlA7nprMc_VraNXjf3ZRFTbirubqyuNvj3CQAU4OTHchOAfTg0JLIrqD82Od4P5RNHn8UvUSACLgNkiWC6H4NIhZPsyiS-dqiNk2xSa7HROpk_K=w1440-h1080-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mUbMEZZQ3oGBxeqw6y0s1Ee_WGOWWcNnZ3zeRT0ExYBdCKJNgdcj3PNwxOxBf8Pt1eBEcr-bRArg7ZtA-hrAh3IEfd1avJxPewZ2QooCl9ibPMd4zcTEmQVjd0FDpLWCwqhZdtCCC0mmMk3AD7UF8n_WINUEybW63C8CE0ttVFJzdD4edmr4H-3BapJLd2kRdfG5ifRodUO5KkZsLcQtcGUbTYIDJWzs3J4Ijb-G5Ax80OQdgHLlhjUSpGJ9uQNJ_-JkpgypKRGE5OpK3_OFAqYOq_AYQvaEkz9WmOUeLjI_n4kXlJGUjiu5-rybvT7Oswc8iSxqedjskMlFZFfCmL1A_K3ZRx7foBC8s1gdnigzUJU48Dw7lPCjp9-7Gz3VaBeq6bdzQL-HurwFbxwUF16k5yxvZ_h1tett6jpaiADX5frvd9ZTK8TdSqWdGsnbT8zNLLSBPRYYeuOZWxp45HL-kZrYaqcvBBaa900-A4BQFzmUzP6KO8PsfOlieW3lzVG_fUrXacU4JlYCdLBa7q2_YSoh_GMFX5HEwCX23nSo=w1440-h1080-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2lPmzUu82FpK-bF10uC-AJpZ8xIWniOm2cCYIRfno-lDDrHJp5zBVeNAPCaaBZMwDVZ_wv9-tiO4OVMUyv90BGrb3cpDcawOhIjnkkM5FtDsXUzWoa9hfnflZZ7wgFq13L44Si8-D4RHJ17O8KP8aKIOKPDpYr_MbISDtZtCZh9enMUhh-1esqJO16NL8-suXV6hO6JlMnyzjQwFNeww9sUlZuwprBxko5kC1YvUsa1Vk69b02093F_4JuCdlWORn_SJA97gLJzvlnDVI3HIZYQ41o0e2JJA0SEdMgv9PRki8xj4fJtI_E2W_DdiYKPg3AulAqqO0Qx9i9q9pMjUZEiNmjzAFa_BcAWYSPRb27EM8s8BujPmrAWM8AxNpE2mjd0OJRddfyJlkVXZyu0j6PJizFjtEP43x6uSPcgL5SrNdACc4g8EVrth-qPHxy2eOnhYgEtc-wR80827fG_pKrzy8nwUfVmIEMbtOHRf1zD06ZNVPjqADJ8CSbxv5vOAP-DZNKtUnK4AViSQA8OpchyEQRquO5A8NeFuN9qKZLez=w1440-h1080-no","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c28b","name":"chocolate","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29e","name":"oatmeal","slug":"oatmeal"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29f","name":"granola","slug":"granola"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"chocolate","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
