Plus, now every time I think of Drake, I picture him <a href=\"https://youtu.be/uxpDa-c-4Mc\">doing his little &quot;dance&quot;</a> over and over again. It brings me a <strong>LOT</strong> of joy.

I was not aware that this was an <em>ACTUAL</em> holiday but I'm not gonna complain. I firmly believe that everyday should be National Chocolate Cake Day! But hey, I'll take one day a year.</p>\n<p>Second, it's your lucky week! You get TWO whole posts from me! I've been sick since Sunday, so I've been vegetating on my couch, watching a few too many chick flicks, all whilst drinking the world's supply of ginger chai <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/an-ode-to-chai/\">(hence my caffeine-fueled poem on Sunday which you should also totally read and appreciate)</a>.</p>\n<p>So, let's get to it!</p>\n<p>As the self-designated baker for my friend group, I've been baking birthday cakes for pretty much everyone. I've been trying to tailor each cake to something either they've specifically requested or what I think they would enjoy. This cake in particular was for one of my friends who loves whiskey. Her only requirement was that, and I quote, &quot;I do not kill her.&quot; I took it as a challenge in that I was going to put as much alcohol as possible in the cake while retaining its ability to taste good.</p>\n<p>Three things happened with this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I made a deliciously boozy cake</li>\n<li>I finished a LOT of the whiskey bottle I bought for this very specific purpose.</li>\n<li>I ended up getting fairly tipsy after a few batter taste tests</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>I also feel like I should include a warning: raw batter means raw eggs which also means the potential for salmonella. So be careful not to eat spoonfuls of your cake batter! That could get you very sick. Enjoy responsibly ;)</em></p>\n<p>Honestly, I'd say it was a completely successful experience. I totally recommend making boozy desserts to everyone (of legal age of course). :P Just don't expect to be productive after you put the cake in the oven. I had absolutely no attention span once I set that cake to bake. I ended up making one GIANT cake for my friend, another little one for the rest of us to enjoy on our own, and a few cupcakes for my coworkers to enjoy. I kid you not, I was swarmed and the cupcakes were gone within 20 minutes of me sending an email announcing the arrival of whiskey cupcakes. I'm now officially known as the dessert lady at work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zh4hcqy50kwhftm3na4bh6oy0944s31z.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Chocolate Whiskey Cake</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to increase/decrease the amount of whiskey according to your taste/tolerance.

Otherwise the eggs will cook when you add the coffee to it. Set your oven to preheat at 350 degrees.</p>\n        <p>Whisk the eggs, whiskey, buttermilk, and oil together in one bowl. Once the coffee is chilled, whisk that in as well.</p>\n        <p>In a separate bowl, stir the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt together. Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with all the dry ingredients. Make sure to keep stirring while you pour.</p>\n        <p>Whisk until smooth. Taste to make sure the whiskey level is right. If not add more whiskey/flour accordingly.</p>\n        <p>Spray your cake pan (or place cupcake liners in your cupcake pan if you're making cupcakes) and pour in the batter. Set your timer for about 25-30 minutes (or 18-21 minutes for cupcakes) and wait! Poke the cake with a fork or toothpick (something that can reach fairly deep inside the cake). If it comes out clean, you're done! Cool the cake in the pan for 15 minutes, frost and devour!</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I did get lazy when it came to the frosting and just bought some chocolate frosting from the store. I felt it might be a little TOO much if I spiked that too, so I just spread shit tons of frosting on top of the cake/cupcakes and ate it. I'd say that was the better choice! If you're going easy on the whiskey inside the cake itself (or in the words of my friend, &quot;are being a little bitch&quot;), then maybe you can spike the frosting. Otherwise you've got enough alcohol in there to get the deed done.</p>\n<div class=\"container\">\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-2.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-3.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-10.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-15.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-9.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\">\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-11.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-12.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n<div class=\"one-third column\"><img src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2015/10/20/drake-dance/drake-13.w529.h352.2x.gif\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Yes.

There are many phases of a best friend reunion, according to this <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/kelseydarragh/when-your-bff-comes-to-town#.nsbQEmYJq\">buzzfeed article</a>. Pretty much every single thing in that article happened, except in our friendship instead of drinking our weight in wine, we cook. And eat.</p>\n<p><strong>A LOT OF FOOD</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-12/8/18/enhanced/webdr11/anigif_original-21914-1449616517-5.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I'm pretty sure Anagha spent 50% of her time at my place and the other 50% at her own parents' house. We didn't even do anything most of the time... I would be working and she would be reading at the opposite end of the table. She had also never met the newest addition to my family, Miggy Pramod, who is basically the most adorable dog known to man.</p>\n<p>True to form, they became best friends immediately.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ijnjkbtgaycn5ddhbx2dwakh9gcrq3ua.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Seriously though, who couldn't love a weirdo that sleeps like this regularly?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/j1fczq8yhjzxhz0ae852f1lu4wqdp00s.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Just look at him.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/8429t2jqhh8zkgv3fuc8vszlqh3y8dbj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This past August, my dad decided that my mom's birthday gift would be to finally get a puppy. My entire family, brimming with excitement, spent hours and hours looking on petfinder.com and various shelter sites for the perfect little CALM addition to our family. After countless shelter visits and close calls with various puppies, we were extremely tired and disheartened. The process of finding the perfect dog for our family had become a lot more emotionally draining than we had originally thought. My mom wasn't sure if she could get attached to another dog and see him/her join another family. Then one day, my parents went to this small little animal hospital in Sterling Heights, MI and instantly became smitten with, what we were told, was a little beagle mix. He was an adorable 18 pound ball of affection who just wanted to play. One week later, he was ready to come home.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/dcypl744jtl2r4ey4gb8xydob6hi09g6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>He was a VERY little 5 month old puppy. Little did we know that the tiny little boy that we brought home was a little more German Shepherd than Beagle. Currently, Miggy is a happy 40 pounds and the obsession of my entire family, weird sleeping positions, ear licking fetishes and all.</p>\n<p>ANYWAYS putting the puppy love aside, whenever we weren't spoiling Miggles with never ending attention, we were watching Netflix and eating All The Brunch. If it hasn't become obvious from some of our <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/brunch-conquers-all/\">previous posts</a>, We <strong>LOVE</strong> brunch. Best of all, it means that we can roll out of bed in our pajamas and enjoy some scrumptiousness that we could concoct using eggs and veggies. Yay Pajamas! YAY Brunch!</p>\n<p>Then, it's time for a relaxing, vacation time food coma. There's that one episode of friends where Joey and Ross discover that they are each other's best nap buddies. Exactly. Who <em>DOESN'T</em> want a nap buddy and best of all your best friend?! So we spent most of our afternoons watching Netflix and chilling (no not like that you perv!) but literally watching Netflix reruns and napping with my puppy.</p>\n<p><strong>Best. Break. Ever.</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://45.media.tumblr.com/78bddaf03bdfb59b75a09a3c3db38b10/tumblr_ngbxx0rIAb1snhpyjo1_r1_500.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We also love Mexican food. No explanation needed. It's just the best. So OBVIOUSLY nothing could be better than combining the two things we are always craving. In came chilaquiles.</p>\n<p>I've had varieties of chilaquiles in the past. From the beaches of Cancun to the streets of San Francisco and San Diego. Everywhere, they put their own spin on the classic Mexican dish. Traditionally it's kept very simple with just fried tortillas, salsa, egg, and beans (and/or meat). California, on the other hand, tends to add avocado to everything so it's very colorful. Our variation probably includes WAY more vegetables than most but I love it and it tasted delicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fco4k8iom9446zmbd42f9dby9n7o3cmn.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/9r2pggwyj4j7fre2tlxu47nhkj2be8mh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/3g098w0hj52qe8k9d45ddalcfxo4a2oh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/eb3enu78qybtf2rl2qygx4gx64l9r7zn.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Chilaquiles</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 bottle <a href=\"http://www.lavictoria.com/products/salsa/thickn-chunky-salsa-verde-medium/\">Salsa Verde</a></li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 bag tortilla chips</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 can black beans</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\"><a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/estoy-cantando/\">Sumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning</a></li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 avocado cubed</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg per person</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">sour cream</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">cheese (shredded or Cotija)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">chopping cilantro to garnish</li>\n        <h4>Pico De Gallo Salsa</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 roma tomatoes</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 onion diced</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">lemon juice to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">salt to taste</li>\n        <h4>Corn Salsa</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 can sweet corn kernels</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">4 sliced jalapeños (more or less based on your spice tolerance)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">lemon juice to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">salt to taste</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Put two handfuls of tortilla chips in a pan and cover with the salsa verde.

One song. All week. Why you may ask? DUH...BECAUSE IT'S AMAZING.</p>\n<p>(Now's when you play this song and dance along while finishing to read this post.)</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5cR7culxUEPLhzIC0KWAH1\" width=\"auto\" max-width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>My brother was visiting me for a week and I quickly realized 1) apparently no one comes to work during the holidays in my office, meaning sub-par lunches and dinners all week and 2) I hadn't done groceries in weeks, meaning I didn't have anything to feed the kid while he was staying with me. Being the ever so responsible adult that I am, I decided that I could muster enough patience to cook lunches and dinners for my brother a few times, or at least while I was working from home. We braved it out to a farmers market and brought back a collection of various vegetables without any idea of what to make. While brainstorming ideas my brother decided that since he was spending a week in California, he was going to try and eat Mexican food for each and every meal.</p>\n<p>My next step was to figure out what kind of Mexican dish to make when all I had bought was stir fry vegetables. Voilà! MEXICAN &quot;STIR FRY&quot;! Or I guess as normal people call it... TOSTADA BOWLS!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ve6cm0UWi2klfKNBucW5RQaGauUXPwneEc0sHfvpURDlY3SWKBfcYAQLCJK3Q2I7uSZdo2ulwfO1mmXmKWbZ56btcUQ7m3i5eay2g4qi-f4FaQtX-vYoiSZHueaiJjhMGIWs-sVJY68eBCXO2Aj5ctKAmXCHAKEriVCYSAMdo4ThgSXyixQxiO7-FNwcDa9fhjyVdSm2euwAOJC3l92hTmva72-XsHiX4ir8ElyAZFpvOS9nQ1j0kDCzfx0J4nYPfKAzJp7wDVWQUkQsDW90frbjnFfpEeUw_gl_n2DzR7x9r5tbjC4I9M1OqHmlgp-mhJZ46I8L2olUEqEcXkvcRiVPJFNlfMJyx4YRU5KPR8G921KOOy_0l_68mWlZSdTlIH6-De6xwXGCL9lR2sQ-CIxdIFGumGYlH35G8I8bo2GHZw5eG2org0oKpi0QYd8373sOFzMMElqSdAKsatEayenx7iGKBPLngoAK3m5cH5b7IxHHymlLi-baaZRFwgiqMqyiH2l7xu2htVeC_zTfpPjJNr-_0eDiAJmh1I5pEykrD5Sy44vuiUjnbicZMeTC4hn_tg=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There's not really a recipe for this post because honestly I kind of made it up on the spot. BUT I can give you some bits and pieces of what went in this so you can make your own variation of this dish at home! (I KNOW, how sweet of me.)</p>\n<p>This dish is essentially a layer of cilantro lime rice, refried beans, vegetables sautéd fajita style, salmon (totally optional and honestly kinda ruined the dish for me, my brother's vegetarian one was on point), guacamole, sour cream and cotija cheese a.k.a. fancy Mexican cheese. Plus you can throw some chopped green onions on top to make it look all pretty and fancy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CeNqsYp63uvCaplae3zBaDNLdex2SHlc0IMJSkMjUmFjsv59YL92AaEDRfHi6nIko0QnXSz8DBH81h1C0rvKzWi4GatpUqH3aT2QXl1ws6cH6QqprP6Enh2oNuG2VegDD94fbVobszPLMNhKqMw-CsTpJcyjH-Jb8hvmJNfmalrGrUhGVZZijJBAUM-IAE5sFkFBPRHdDtdLBMV_DZh7VHm40qWDhdQyzu7RJd_uGhmOcecFMuvr8zlSlx8G4zotPn2E6qRxUpExV8JHKsbZAlpB443QUuMVdJ6gHjR3xgp_3YOaxY2lopHf19vQ7x7oJHe5UaFqRrLK1eVUBETrB_Jc1dmWJS-LVOk8f6mjkbJt0v01VmxHTdw5HmvikvgTOXPTN5ha0w-VX1KhLxd5hohLEGei2FNAc_gCX1cZWzmxiy2uj6vZoeqKDg8VQgjYJGTbzmHKenzKWsI0GfX4wd0wcsMlEWcETm0_t8A6aFXQpXuw5im8BxIPfd-csF8tzSGUEKVCwkl1KahFAkwEeLPtMCmxhlSo1I-m91MXYv7aVws1Diu8quyH-ZLVcE5jzXzO6A=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I've always loved making Mexican food. It's so flavorful and deliciously rewarding every time! Every single part of a burrito/taco/bowl is overflowing with unique tastes that seem extremely complicated and intricate. I'll let you in on a little secret...I use the same seasoning to cook every single part of any Mexican dish I make. Whether it be the refried beans or fajita vegetables, it's all various spice levels of the same recipe. I'm sure that's not how authentic Mexican food is made, but hey...mine tastes pretty damn good too.</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Sumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to mess around with the proportions of each ingredient!

Sometimes I add some cumin or replace the jalapeños with cayenne pepper if I'm feeling dangerous. To go off on a tangent, couldn't you watch this gif of guacamole being made forever? 1) I feel really bad for/impressed by the person who disrobed all those avocados and 2) I just want to dive into that bowl tongue first.

Just sauté the vegetables of your choosing with some oil and fajita seasoning, heat up a can of black beans on the stove with fajita seasoning, whip up a bowl of guac, season some rice, and pile it all into a bowl for maximum enjoyment.</p>\n<p><strong>YUM</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xL6ZZyTvHTSpJMlQKsTrnE-Hi1wZGxznWgD_ObbvWbklroelEJZ_VbrWWy94DcXKg5L0YkmD8QDXcGwO22F5FGrF239GfqSLpVLztVqeBRdZvJD3Jc6MAz34MwIAlofEobmL9DERXd5mnUr8QLuB6BFV-0xhD_a6QGAgQJ4cmT9_43BOz3KM62S4BUUgVmaOJlWKdrhmR2ofdLorNosZgzIDYgTz_HXwvI1gqFOXM3xuNSM6al6BHDzGZ4kaU0FULQK2yqYeVhjmITl18AMrkF7kAWEHQg2tqlKwkjUr-3rHanBHgZkTLGL8VUFW7HFhkDueldqQf2ncPqYnWaNX5QS9SkTsItWwwa3B9KMHkLUy_67Kvj9XZO0UsPqEE2KFPwTc9fRnp5_Q99tD4prLJOEOe163hnXwv_CqGdoUqvZ7XAOllyG5KSDf9l8Eh6xEGk2m2KjFV7PTGe-cLtWs1PQXK_luSKEbHRYRudXOEzt4tXAC9D5p_7NgVdDFabK0nnyeB1ZyF0TxgBJ3aeX95mu5Xuji-19kMRtRm4MIy4SrkPgGzg4-aUDjWa3dKhSTQWPnQg=w1974-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ewDBn95P9kq6uqHSJWTKr6oWxcR3SMcgHkeY-RbMuo1yNwiTJPxKkukIbJF-JWHEFymzYXjq_CAvb8ipFVPramGvtS6YZtFQOAQKXFciCOrzGF9JKRjNKWA5REjGuiNj8OIuNBTDWnmS2ihENrJvss7ISYcsaKA4Ar7GoEgtkqQESGinvSi7zcA6G72cid8hAl-ppVQZ5lIWlJaOkpApzI89lG_XAinfFXNtku5PvS5fRY2ciVY5r6_U9L3DMy5fIRVRKfXNSgUzbU6SHmg8yFtqnsy-DhSMZffu7-boB5gHuY8wbYt5LHVG89pa8eVecezdiLQtAedqFwo3ggBgqDnLZ0OXpVSe0duttQKIKTnAdA9NPelgIqOKwfPwUZHVi6cTxpIdZfwiildi3OuS7Ps13dn8IZJu-m5oIF3XOjvtokCgR3zOaUy0IIVkfo9P0CUrVWyuko20DXOrrcO4MPwhRjjzHYtIrcoopywcZN_fOkbtB-xHLKEjhO7idj_yaLU_EsqrMJihJiz7oduRC7668bpvdW7GfeUuc_IaLHPE5lhchhjBERJ9jdhk2p9OSGku5g=w1386-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>ALSO!
