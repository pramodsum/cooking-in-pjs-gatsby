And I figured if I made them all blue and yellow then all the better... GO BLUE! I looked at the recipe, saw the ingredients and was confident that this dessert was within my range of baking abilities. In fact, I was SO confident that I called a friend of mine to come over and reap the benefits of my baking!</p>\n<p>Clearly such confidence could only yield brilliant results.</p>\n<p><strong>WRONG</strong></p>\n<p>Making macarons is a very delicate process that requires a lot more patience and skill than I had ever anticipated! And for that very reason, the adorable macarons I had been picturing in my head came out like this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JjfOtdZpKGPUnJWQXW5VSqnS-09Xoi1kbel7l62Q72S2=w1756-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Exactly like you picture macarons in French Patisseries right?! I know... I was just as disappointed as you. It basically became some strange almond flavored fruit roll ups. Not at all appetizing. Now there was another problem... I had a <strong>TON</strong> of almond batter that clearly wasn't going to make macarons and no idea what to do with it. My cousin saved my ass and suggested I just convert them into almond cupcakes.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I think it was my disappointment at failing to make macrons but I half heartedly made these cupcakes. So much so that I didn't even bother with my usual photo shoot of the final masterpiece. I have absolutely no photos of what they turned out to look like. Nada. Zilch. But imagine they looked something like this except light yellow and blue with little almond specs all inside.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.afarmgirlsdabbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/530_IMG_7507_white-cupcakes.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>They weren't especially sweet cupcakes so I figured they needed some kind of topping to balance out the flavors. I went back and made some of my handy caramel bourbon sauce, which is just melted caramel, a little water, and some <a href=\"http://www.southerncomfort.com/age?ref=caramel\">Caramel Southern Comfort</a>. First off, it's heavenly and just a little boozy. Secondly, it basically takes you 2 minutes to make.</p>\n<p>Finally having somewhat salvaged this disaster, I took the box of what I thought was my failures to work. After keeping it out in the lounge area, I quickly learned that the combination of almond cupcakes with caramel bourbon sauce works.... like <strong>really</strong> works.</p>\n<p>Anyways, here's what I think was the makeshift cupcake recipe. More or less...</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>\"Macaron\" Almond Cupcakes</h2>\n    <em>If the consistency doesn't seem like normal cupcake batter, add more flour.
