So, I'm starting a new feature! The &quot;Quick Recipe Fix&quot; - your dose of some of my favorite recipes that I've found on the interwebs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/e1ww9g1kidb63ndvuqe4zzlsqv8mjane.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Enjoy the recipes, and cut me some slack, internet. I've been busy :)</p>\n<p>1.) Love and Lemons is one of my favorite food blogs; they have gorgeous pictures, and I love their fresh approach to food. They have a cookbook out right now that everyone should totally get. I'm also waiting for the day when I can try this recipe for <a href=\"http://www.loveandlemons.com/chickpea-flour-pizza-asparagus/?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds\">Chickpea Flour Pizza Crust</a> because YUM.</p>\n<p>2.) Minimalist Baker hits it out of the park every time. They have a real talent for finding fresh, simple recipes with easy (and short!) cleanup! Check out their recipe for <a href=\"http://minimalistbaker.com/gingery-thai-kale-salad-cashew-dressing/\">Gingery Thai Kale Salad with Cashew Dressing</a></p>\n<p>3.) I love Annie's Eats, especially her cocktail posts! Now that summer's coming, it's time to turn out minds to summertime cocktails, and there's something about this <a href=\"http://www.annies-eats.com/2016/03/25/gin-grapefruit-and-rosemary-cocktail/\">Gin, Grapefruit, and Rosemary Cocktail</a> that feels delightfully spring-y.</p>\n<p>4.) Smitten Kitten is incredibly prolific; they do an amazing job of posting super frequently with high quality recipes! Here's one of there's that I'm pretty sure is an Italian sort of Shakshouka <a href=\"http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2016/03/eggs-in-purgatory-puttanesca-style/\">Eggs in Purgatory, Puttanesca-Style</a>.</p>\n<p>5.) The Beeroness is one of my favorite people on the internet. All of her recipes are accompanied by great stories about her life, and the food itself is nothing to sneeze at. If you're a beer lover OR a food lover, you'll love her blog; right now, I really want to try her <a href=\"http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2016/03/eggs-in-purgatory-puttanesca-style/\">Grilled Garlic-Beer Flatbread</a>.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the recipes, and if you get a chance to try them before I do (super likely) let me know how it goes!</p>\n","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/75ycreg8gpwyyvfdmpmdtiomxiop1sg4.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c26b","name":"food truck","slug":"food-truck"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c242","name":"giggle juice","slug":"giggle-juice"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c314","name":"loving lately","slug":"loving-lately"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c315","name":"favorite blogs","slug":"favorite-blogs"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c316","name":"yum","slug":"yum"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c35f","uuid":"e0f988c3-12d8-419a-b327-025e484d0fd2","title":"When a moon hits your eye like a big pizza pi(e)","slug":"when-a-moon-hits-your-eye-like-a-big-pizza-pi","published_at":"07 April, 2016","html":"<p>March 14th is a very famous day.

It took me a LONG time until I realized that it was intended to begin at 3/14 1:59, which are the next few digits in pi.</p>\n<p>Once I got over how clutch that was, I began planning what I would bake to enter in this competition. There were tons of categories including best newbie, most creative, best savory, best sweet, etc. I decided I would do something different and make a savory pie, but what to make... THEN I realized I could make Indian savory pies (cover my dinner for a few days) and attempt to blow everyone's minds. I decided to enter 2 pies: a paneer tikka pie and a samosa pie. Yes, I am very well aware that a samosa pie is really just a LARGE samosa, it's just semantics. I have also realized I have watched too much Psych when I use the phrase &quot;it's just semantics&quot; excessively.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://gif.co/rqOE.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Since I decided to experiment so much you guys get TWO recipes this week all wrapped up inside one post. I know we're terrible people who haven't posted in a bit, but I promise we'll make it up to you guys and more. Since I used frozen pie crust, the overall time I spent baking was actually not as long as I had anticipated. I'm not going to write out the whole pie recipe because its fairly generic and you can follow the timings/instructions on the pie crust box itself. I made double crusted pies (where theres crust below and on top of the filling) so I just followed the instructions on the top pie crust box. It was something like this <a href=\"http://www.pillsbury.com/products/pie-crust/refrigerated-pie-crust\">crust</a>, the kind you roll out and lay on top of the pie.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/exwct8krjwx28uvx3j7ksk7g91ey4yp5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There's actually some chicken tikka mini pies in that picture above but that was mainly for myself ;)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/to0z9d01k9mh9k6oawuos5lkkm3ftzrw.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Paneer Tikka Pi(e) Filling</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Uncooked paneer, cubed</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">4 tbsp tandoori masala powder (I really like Kissan Tandoori Masala)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Dahi (curds)</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Mix the tandoori masala and 2-3 large spoons of dahi  together in a large bowl.

There are so many different varieties of food I love making and it makes no sense for me to maintain a kitchen stocked with ALL the ingredients for whenever I'd want to make any of these things. Usually when I post recipes, I try to use the ingredients I already have, can make substitutes, or keep the grocery shopping to a minimum. #LivinLaVidaLazy</p>\n<p>I didn't have some of the specific ingredients so I used a bunch of more commonly available substitutes and tasted it every now and then if I needed to make adjustments. My recipe is roughly based on a recipe from <a href=\"http://www.gimmesomeoven.com/homemade-bbq-sauce-recipe/\">Gimme Some Oven</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.foodrenegade.com/homemade-worcesterschire-sauce/\">Food Renegade</a>. However, doubt me as you will, I had my friend who's grown up in Texas taste test my sauce and he loved it. You don't mess with Texans and their BBQ sauce... they know their sauce. He did give me one suggestion that I'll pass along to you guys, which was to add Liquid Smoke. Personally I have no idea what that is, but apparently it is life changing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/q2bizza1yo67mf7ke4n847seddnm2uf4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/w9jluoe11rs0l2tern4fe91qkw8mnlzj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Homemade BBQ Sauce</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup molasses</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup mustard</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup red wine (or apple cider vinegar)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp paprika</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp garlic powder</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp freshly ground garlic</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">salt to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">a few pinches of cayenne pepper to taste</li>\n          <h4>Tomato Sauce + Paste</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">3 Roma tomatoes, pureed</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup ketchup (or puree 1 more tomato with some salt)</li>\n          <h4>\"Worcestershire\" Sauce</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup red wine (or apple cider vinegar)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tbsp molasses</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tbsp tamarind paste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Juice of 1 lime</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 tsp ground clove</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 tsp garlic</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 tsp chili powder</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Whisk all the ingredients together in a saucepan over medium heat.

I just devoured it on various types of crackers I had at home. Best thing about this sauce is that you can use it in SO many different ways. Not only did I use it for pulled chicken, but we coated some fried tofu with the sauce to take our fresh rolls to a whole new level.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/txb7aup0o1j84cpq3ihiexnvwev1qhha.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fioewthw07p9j1xq43a87jt6m61qgfjk.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ph5xt6ynrfqy9k96ey3envqni9s144p6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/9rqxf3dpvx4qrfmuuqcosdfr6sjjv3v2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/kqopbbjcm03630m09ngp3rwrz80cic29.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ra36zozb7as5vdbnv29dogkxx2kly1wg.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/9rqxf3dpvx4qrfmuuqcosdfr6sjjv3v2.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fc","name":"bbq","slug":"bbq"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fd","name":"southern","slug":"southern"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c246","name":"carnivores","slug":"carnivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fe","name":"sauce","slug":"sauce"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ff","name":"comfort","slug":"comfort"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c300","name":"country","slug":"country"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c372","uuid":"329792b8-9854-417e-a287-153b2af1d843","title":"Bhaaji Re Bhaaji Re Bhaaji RE!","slug":"bhaaji-re-bhaaji-re-bhaaji-re","published_at":"03 March, 2016","html":"<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/g4ab45jrsci3hv02dt7a9s8744otld65.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>So just to make up for my epic fail(s) these past weeks, I'm giving you 2 songs to listen to during this post!! (And to console an angry friend of mine :) I love you!)</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3\">\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" wmode=\"Opaque\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6VBAGMkTjTs?wmode=transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>Last month was the Super Bowl. Probably one of the MOST hyped up events in the United States. Usually, I'm not affected by much of this hype. There have even been years where I've forgotten to watch the Super Bowl altogether. I know. HOW COULD I? How very un-American of me. But nonetheless, if my team wasn't playing I was generally not too interested.</p>\n<p>This year was different. I've been in a Super Bowl city before; Detroit hosting in 2006. I probably lived about the same distance from all the events then than I did this time around, but this time was different. Super Bowl 50 was hosted by the city of San Francisco this year. Hilariously enough, the ACTUAL stadium that the teams were going to play at was a good 50 miles away from San Francisco. So TECHNICALLY the Super Bowl was hosted by the city of Santa Clara, but how many people actually know where that is?</p>\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n<p>So all the official hubbub leading up to the Super Bowl was held in downtown San Francisco. They set up this huge thing called &quot;Super Bowl City&quot; with various events starting a little more than a week before the actual big game. They had EVERYTHING; the puppy bowl, player signings, concerts (including the amazing Alicia Keys). San Francisco really pulled out all the stops for the event.</p>\n<p>I live in Sunnyvale right now. It's a little suburb town about 45 miles from downtown San Francisco. Usually, no issue. It's a quiet little area with lots of families and anything and everything Indian you could ever want. I'm really not kidding about that. There's a Indian grocery or jewelry or clothing or something store in each and every strip mall complex (I think that's what they're called anyways...) I legitimately give people directions to my house by telling them to go to Madras Cafe (one of the most popular dosa places in all of the Bay Area) and then turn onto my street instead of going into that restaurant. Ultimately it means that I'm dragged to that restaurant more than I'd ever like, me being someone who dislikes dosa (go on...hate on me all you want I am that South Indian that doesn't like dosa).</p>\n<p>Anyways... why is this important you may ask? Sunnyvale just HAPPENS to be approximately a 10 minute drive from the new and shiny Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara. The very stadium that happened to be hosting the Super Bowl last weekend. I know, lucky me! I get to go see all these tailgates and do all these cool football related things. Don't get me wrong... I LOVE football but it made me very bitter all weekend. In case you forgot, all the cool and fun events that were happening for the Super Bowl were happening in downtown San Francisco. So no cool pre-Super Bowl events for me. You'd think that AT LEAST I'd get to do some fun things the day of.... NOPE you thought wrong. Apparently you either needed to have specific connections/be a season ticket holder OR you needed to cough up some serious money to participate in all of these tailgating events. Levi's Stadium also has a strict no-tailgating policy for their parking lots, so I didn't get to attend anything. Clearly I'm not bitter at all about this.</p>\n<p>Anyway, my Super Bowl plans consisted of making an large amount of Pav Bhaaji and watching the game with my friend whilst we stuffed our faces. I was going to add a little bit of a rant about the Coldplay halftime show but that's for another time. I may not be a complete fan of Coldplay's Hymn for the Weekend music video but I do love the song...so I was very disappointed that they cut it from the Super Bowl halftime performance.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:3RiPr603aXAoi4GHyXx0uy\" width=\"auto\" max-width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>Regardless, we had pav bhaaji to console us over Chris Martin being the left shark of this year's Super Bowl. Pav Bhaji is a wonderful, buttery delicacy from the streets of Mumbai. I'm thoroughly convinced that pav bhaaji tastes better when you get it from grungier and shadier places, aka a variety of street vendors. What street food doesn't taste better, when it's made and served to you from a giant stove in the middle of some market?!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_LFy3UYws2Y/hqdefault.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I did have a slight mishap in making the pav bhaaji. I was so concentrated on combining a few different recipes into one that I absent-mindedly added bisibelebaath masala instead of pav bhaaji masala. While I do love me some bisibelebaath... the masala doesn't quite give you the taste you're looking for in pav bhaaji. So there I was, watching my disaster simmer and cook on my stove while the clock ticked down to the start of the game. Then I realized that I may have some the ingredients in my spice rack to make my own make-shift pav bhaaji masala. Pav bhaaji masala is made by grinding cardamom, coriander seeds, cumin, fennel seeds, dry chilies, cinnamon sticks, cloves, and dry mango powder. I somehow had most of these things, so I proceeded to add varied amounts of dry mango powder, cumin powder, ground cardamoms, and coriander seeds until it tasted close to pav bhaaji I like.</p>\n<p>Not in any way perfect, but not bad either! My friend being the sweetheart that he is claimed that he loved it! I feel like he was just being a nice friend so I highly recommend getting the pav bhaaji masala and using that instead of making your own with w/e you have in your kitchen. It'll just taste better and closer to what you would have wanted to begin with.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/f7wa8q2kf71bf86gecd2viybgn70o510.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Pav Bhaaji</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Ghee</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 bell pepper, chopped</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup water</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">4 roma tomatoes, chopped</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">4 medium potatoes, chopped</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup cauliflower florets</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/2 tsp ginger-garlic paste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 onion, chopped</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp pav bhaaji masala</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/2 tbsp red chili powder</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp garam masala powder</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp turmeric</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tbsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek) powder</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">lime wedges for garnish</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">some chopped onion for garnish</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">salt according to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">pav buns (plain slider buns can also work)</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>In your pressure cooker, cook the potatoes and cauliflower until soft and tender.</p>\n        <p>Add butter (or ghee :D) to a large pan.
