I usually just end up making really small quantities which barely justifies all the ingredients I would have needed to get to make the desserts. At work I noticed that anytime someone brought in donuts or anything else, people would hunt the food down and devour it. Figuring this the was the best opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, so I whipped up a few batches of the brownies and brought them to work.</p>\n<p>First, I sent an email to my team and only a few people grabbed some. I thought I had made a complete mistake making so many brownies, or maybe I was delusional about how the brownies tasted since I had made them. As a last option, I sent an email out to the whole company and left them in the common area of my floor. Twenty minutes later when I went to go check on them, I saw an empty box. Clearly the brownies had been a huge hit! Now that I've found the perfect group to sample all of my treats, I can bake without worries! My coworkers can expect a flood of baked goods at least once a month from here on out while I use them as guinea pigs for all the different desserts I've always wanted to make! :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7711/17154413587_86e925b5aa_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7766/16741602133_ec8f6f5fc7_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Personally, I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake, but these little bites are amazing. At first when I bit into one, it was perfectly gooey and chocolatey and with a little bit of cheesecake to top off the flavor. I honestly wasn't sure if I hadn't cooked them all the way, but after thoroughly inspecting and devouring a few, I realized that that's just the way the brownies cook! Each brownie was perfectly gooey yet filled with flavors just melting in your mouth. The cheesecake portion was the perfect compliment for the sweetness of the brownies. Try the recipe yourself and let me know how you like it!</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Chocolate Chip Cheesecake Brownie Bites</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <h4>Brownie Part:</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ cup melted unsalted butter</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup sugar</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 large eggs</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ cup all-purpose flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>\n      <h4>Cheesecake Part:</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">8 oz softened cream cheese</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ cup sugar</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg yolk</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

Cronut Fever. A chef in New York City decided that he would take croissant dough and fry it like a donut. This scrumptious flaky dessert became <strong>SO</strong> popular that there was even a black market for them! People would pay $100 on the black market for a cronut that could be bought for $5 if they waited in line for a day.</p>\n<p>I'd never tasted a cronut before in my life, so I decided to make use of a bunch of stale croissants I had lying around after a road trip. I tore the croissants into bite size pieces and fried them in hot oil and count to 4. Quickly flip each cronut and fry again for 4 counts. Make sure not to cook them for too long or they get a little too crunchy and burn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uItKVRYVHXTTy-8axm084k_HfxLO6xzEZdPLVsRCD4KB=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Place the fried bites onto paper towels to drain any excess oil. When cooled, drizzle with any icing of your choice or enjoy them by themselves!</p>\n<p>They were flaky yet crunchy, salty yet buttery. It was amazing! I completely understand what the fuss was in New York City at the time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t7G8JSAQTWhF4tYo7phZ4pW0JmJUR3wW9tfbTtKWJiYd=s800\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jSVFKsebGkxhYqNYuiNsVIhtieIrE3c0NZTu-IJJw5VK=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>However, I learned a few things while making these. Making them with store-bought croissants is fine, however you get the proper ratio of flakiness to fried crunchiness when you use croissant dough. It is also easier not to burn them while frying when you use dough. I am not a huge fan of too much oil, so frying the croissants wasn't my favorite. Maybe there's a way to shallow fry them where they won't pick up too much oil, but I have no idea. Next time I try making cronut bites, I will try to bake store-bought croissants and see if that makes a difference. Who knows!</p>\n<p>For the mean time, I completely suggest you try making these at home! They're simple to make and taste amazing! If you're too lazy then I'd recommend going to your local pastry shop and seeing if they make something similar!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_h3gaGiFbUHaUe_a9dnjOu6yMLoZv8oXEt19I2f1god5=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"Well Son, When a Croissant Loves a Donut...","slug":"well-son-when-a-croissant-loves-a-donut","published_at":"27 June, 2015","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I3bLdLcbLHBZH2QIeDqAX55etYu-5I1Tz94-7LJ62KRW=s800","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23d","slug":"brunch"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23f","slug":"breakfast"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c27d","slug":"donuts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c283","slug":"cronut"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c284","slug":"fried"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c285","slug":"croissant"}]}}}
