I made my first\nsolo move as an adult. I packed up my apartment in Sunnyvale and finally  moved\nto San Francisco. If you're wondering why I picked this specific Van Morrison\nsong, I felt like it was meant to be. The song Saint Dominic's Preview has a lot\nof references to the Saint Dominic's Church on the intersection of Bush and\nSteiner in San Francisco, literally a block from my new apartment. Everyday when\nI walk back from the bus stop after work, I pass by this gorgeous church and\nadmire it. It just felt right to pick this song for the post. :)\n\nHowever, if that song isn't your speed and you want something a little more\nsultry, try this one by Carmen McRae.\n\nI've had a blast since moving out here. I get to see my friends almost every\nday. I have a wonderful new roommate who I've known since college. Even after\nonly a week, I've got to attend all sorts of weird and yet awesome things! This\nwas an art exhibit that was installed right outside City Hall over this past\nweek.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd best of all, I get to cook with my friends, both old and new! I went over to\na friend's place yesterday night and me and a new friend, Kerry, began to make\nsome DELICIOUS fresh spring rolls. Granted, the recipe for this has been posted\non this site before, the food could never have been more delicious and\ndifferent. We filled these with lettuce, shrimp, vermicelli noodles, and more!\nWe even made some peanut sauce to dip the rolls in (just mix some hoisin sauce\nand creamy peanut butter together). Simple, yet delicious!\n\nWe did have some mishaps during the process. San Francisco kitchens are usually\nTINY, as are a lot of the apartments. My friend's kitchen is very much sizable\nfor 1 person cooking. When you try to squeeze 4 people in there, chaos ensues.\n\n 1. We were lied to about the presence of peanut butter, hence sending the boys\n    on one trip to the store\n 2. Kerry and I weren't aware that the pasta strainer LOCKED onto the pot we\n    were cooking the noodles in. This unfortunately caused ALL of the noodles to\n    fall into the sink, hence a second trip to the store to get more noodles\n 3. The boys may never let us live this down. Highly unlikely after all the sass\n    given while Kerry and I made their dinner.\n 4. They showed me this amazing group that performs acoustic covers of popular\n    songs [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y7Vq9749s8]... MIND BLOWING. I'm not\n    gonna lie I may have teared up a bit.\n\nWhile I may not have an explicit recipe for you, I have plenty of photos and\nfull stomachs as proof.

Sorry for the brief and awkward hiatus; it was certainly\nnot our intention, and won't be happening again! Sumu was moving, and I was\nletting law school rain on my parade. But we're back now!\n\n\n\nSumu's all settled into her new apartment in the city, and while law school is\nstill kicking my ass, I've decided to chill out. Law school itself was never the\npoint, and forgetting that is the number one cause of stress for me.\n\nSo, we're kicking off our triumphant return with a throwback recipe. When I got\nto California to visit Sumu, we made fresh rolls. I'll be honest and say that I\ndon't know the difference between a spring roll and a fresh roll. What I do know\nis that fresh rolls, full of bright, delicious veggies and sauces, feel like\nspring time to me.\n\n\n\nThis recipe is easily customizable, for which reason there are no specific\nquantities in the recipe. Do what your heart tells you. Go with your gut. Feel\nout your local grocer and figure out what you can get in what quantities.\n\nSpring is finally here, and while spring break has long since passed, these\nrolls will pretty much always be in season.\n\nSpring Rolls\nThese are the best way to deliver a quick, one two punch of veggies to yo' bod.\nYour mouth and your stomach deserve this meal. This is a pretty sexy recipe,\nwith all the crisp, fresh veggies, the sharp kick from the sriracha and the\nsilky sweetness of hoisin, with some big fresh basil leaves bringing it full\ncircle...I'm drooling just thinking about it! \n\nYield: negotiable\n\nTotal Time:  45 minutes\n\nIngredients:\nComponent 1\nRice paper sheets. Can be found at Asian groceries\n Fresh basil leavesBok choyCarrotsCilantroBeetsBean sproutsHoisin SauceSriracha\nSauceTofuAlfalfa sprouts\n Directions:\n\n1.) Prepare your vegetables. Slice your carrots into matchsticks, steam your bok\nchoy, saute the beets, cook your tofu how you like (we did fried tofu sauted in\nbarbecue sauce) and rinse your bean sprouts, before arranging everything in\nbowls around your workstation.\n\n\n2.) Set a shallow plate full of hot water beside you, and take out a rice paper\nsheet. Dip it into the water for ten seconds, and then lay it out on a cutting\nboard.\n\n\n3.) Layer your veggies and tofu in a mound in the middle of the sheet, then\ndrizzle sauces over it. Fold the two sides over, then roll smoothly from top to\nbottom.\n\n\n4.) Enjoy.
