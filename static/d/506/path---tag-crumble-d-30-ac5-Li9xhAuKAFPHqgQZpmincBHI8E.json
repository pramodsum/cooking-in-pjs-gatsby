Enjoy :P</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3\">\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" wmode=\"Opaque\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WRu_-9MBpd4?wmode=transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>And no, in case you were wondering... I didn't spike these coffee cupcakes with cocaine.</p>\n<p>So, I'm not sure how many of you know this but coffee cake doesn't <em>ACTUALLY</em> have any coffee in it... I KNOW! I was just as disappointed as you are right now. Despite these cakes being a COMPLETE and utter lie, I love them down to the very last crumb.</p>\n<p>Deceit aside, this recipe was actually quite easy to make and also involved me having to make extra crumble topping to replace the amount I ate. I'd recommend doing the same for yourself :P hehe</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hvA6pTqEQm6XcEGxJR1QDpcf775kBo6WBVQX8RZ8ZJlF=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>NOTE: My crumble topping came out kind of clumpy but I think that was mainly because I got lazy and didn't add the ingredients one by one as described in the recipe. Instead, I decided to add everything at the same time and mix it. It doesn't really change the taste that much but I imagine the cinnamon sugar taste is more uniformly present if you make it right.</p>\n<p>Since I didn't really make a custom version of this recipe check out the recipe <a href=\"http://damndelicious.net/2014/03/24/coffee-cake-muffins/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Try the recipe out yourself and let me know what you think!!!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/56VFlyBdexLRsU0d083gX7yRl7EBSF3IzsF5c022mX7f=w998-h1496-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/lFpv1SOuinbynxRRrxpXgQ8ZtffbXztTB9Uh_dz8Tn9D=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9Oi_tL571zkv8PxtTsvTsSfSrMFpGiotPu6odPNVdTpS=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aEbngOn4KZIveHj0kzWNvJS2garGhaPXtBFYA_ABrhtU=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Py-geJ6eWoOITUr4mZ-ZH8QUboRguSauLNU_iOrtXuND=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Py-geJ6eWoOITUr4mZ-ZH8QUboRguSauLNU_iOrtXuND=w1440-h960-no","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c280","name":"coffee","slug":"coffee"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c281","name":"cake","slug":"cake"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c282","name":"crumble","slug":"crumble"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29b","name":"cinnamon","slug":"cinnamon"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"crumble","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
