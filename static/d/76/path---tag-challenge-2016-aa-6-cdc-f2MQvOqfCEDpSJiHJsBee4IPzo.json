For example, I (Anu) spent half the year in India, but you guys never read about my adventures with street food, or my quest to find the best masala dosas in Bangalore. While Sumu kept you all a bit more updated on her goings on, the fact is, we both want to do better.</p>\n<p>So with that in mind, we're challenging ourselves to post once a week each in 2016! You'll be getting a new post from Sumu on Wednesdays, and Anu on Sundays. We'll be sharing bits of our lives and kitchens all year, and in the interest of accountability, we've decided to implement some penalties for failure to deliver.</p>\n<p>Offense 1: Donate ten dollars to a slush fund that we will donate to a charity at the end of the year! Every other penalty on the list is also accompanied by this, so there's potential for us to donate 80 at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Offense 2: The innocent party gets to pick 1 song for you to listen to during your entire commute.</p>\n<p>Offense 3: The innocent party gets to take a picture or pictures with puppies and send it to the offender, to show them what they're missing.</p>\n<p>Offense 4: The Chopped Challenge; the innocent party assigned the offending party a random list of ingredients, from which they must produce and consume a meal. The production of said meal must be videotaped for the innocent party's viewing pleasure.</p>\n<p>Any offenses over and above this will result in the offending party having to complete a dare that is entirely up to the whim of the innocent party. So that's pretty terrifying. All posts will also include the tag #challenge2016 so you can also check up on us.</p>\n<p><strong>May the force be with you</strong></p>\n<p>We hope you're as excited as we are :)<br>\nSumu and Anu</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VZbmOFixe3qVzvC-U7QLvsJcUQeV79GACQl0DPf4gIEKj5oFw27pplxZG6e1UwB7s_FujTfxfHLTyyyLxZlceDET3cC5gD0aItG1FYd_Dl3d1Vo5KWKx5cOJMcvvEjvbNx3-CHg90QmtpBpwjaJvZ7qX6L16KXL1j-nl1JUOuP_HbuqTTLdH0v2FoABqTx6Cmlp5DIvvzZ5YJwxsdmBX9a3uA2mhKdPDd_7covcnCiXsSMakXWaDPFBl5_J2B8joh-lgKgRfACEZrQSLTpPeULuOT5cJuEmxqw-MPQNb50K3P7M5vHgqL1o34_uVf9m5FLevjSWsaz-Ykx_FXq20bTABd10Q7X4P0Bal0NIYMYQ3vaK3Xdi1qcrGtrLhd6C4Yag0d-aq2iqEIj6T39RtlKWMG9jfJWGDpnqGmTn4QDPf3oP-2It0WMFM8TcGvlKOPF41SIHmTpSGmt0Lvc4vpqYHYJ8IuH5KDyJmi87gycu2hiMeqG9Lb1eX971UPP4hXwDfcAyWK2s1mWmmCPsglA4SHXtUntmi7xsfPsIfbxt4VEpf-FrzqtjqlWQaSzrC1Ceu_g=w353-h546-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>NOTE: I (Sumu) have done a complete redesign of the blog so please email me @ <a href=\"mailto:sumu@cookinginpjs.com\">sumu@cookinginpjs.com</a> if you've got any thoughts/bugs/general comments about it so I can address them ASAP!
