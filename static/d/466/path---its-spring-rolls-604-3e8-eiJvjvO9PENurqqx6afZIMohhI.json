Sorry for the brief and awkward hiatus; it was certainly not our intention, and won't be happening again! Sumu was moving, and I was letting law school rain on my parade. But we're back now!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/les6q1cfxgmpzlte37u7exyiu2zh8ciz.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Sumu's all settled into her new apartment in the city, and while law school is still kicking my ass, I've decided to chill out. Law school itself was never the point, and forgetting that is the number one cause of stress for me.</p>\n<p>So, we're kicking off our triumphant return with a throwback recipe. When I got to California to visit Sumu, we made fresh rolls. I'll be honest and say that I don't know the difference between a spring roll and a fresh roll. What I do know is that fresh rolls, full of bright, delicious veggies and sauces, feel like spring time to me.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/phdkcdohsofvt6m9sa21vdx75ruyr006.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This recipe is easily customizable, for which reason there are no specific quantities in the recipe. Do what your heart tells you. Go with your gut. Feel out your local grocer and figure out what you can get in what quantities.</p>\n<p>Spring is finally here, and while spring break has long since passed, these rolls will pretty much always be in season.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3\" style=\"max-width: 640px !important; height: auto;\"><iframe src=\"https://app.box.com/embed/preview/dv94gc5megoxu2129ynqir8vees3f0tt?theme=dark\" width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" msallowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Spring Rolls</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>These are the best way to deliver a quick, one two punch of veggies to yo' bod.

It took me a LONG time until I realized that it was intended to begin at 3/14 1:59, which are the next few digits in pi.</p>\n<p>Once I got over how clutch that was, I began planning what I would bake to enter in this competition. There were tons of categories including best newbie, most creative, best savory, best sweet, etc. I decided I would do something different and make a savory pie, but what to make... THEN I realized I could make Indian savory pies (cover my dinner for a few days) and attempt to blow everyone's minds. I decided to enter 2 pies: a paneer tikka pie and a samosa pie. Yes, I am very well aware that a samosa pie is really just a LARGE samosa, it's just semantics. I have also realized I have watched too much Psych when I use the phrase &quot;it's just semantics&quot; excessively.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://gif.co/rqOE.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Since I decided to experiment so much you guys get TWO recipes this week all wrapped up inside one post. I know we're terrible people who haven't posted in a bit, but I promise we'll make it up to you guys and more. Since I used frozen pie crust, the overall time I spent baking was actually not as long as I had anticipated. I'm not going to write out the whole pie recipe because its fairly generic and you can follow the timings/instructions on the pie crust box itself. I made double crusted pies (where theres crust below and on top of the filling) so I just followed the instructions on the top pie crust box. It was something like this <a href=\"http://www.pillsbury.com/products/pie-crust/refrigerated-pie-crust\">crust</a>, the kind you roll out and lay on top of the pie.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/exwct8krjwx28uvx3j7ksk7g91ey4yp5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There's actually some chicken tikka mini pies in that picture above but that was mainly for myself ;)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/to0z9d01k9mh9k6oawuos5lkkm3ftzrw.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Paneer Tikka Pi(e) Filling</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Uncooked paneer, cubed</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">4 tbsp tandoori masala powder (I really like Kissan Tandoori Masala)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Dahi (curds)</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Mix the tandoori masala and 2-3 large spoons of dahi  together in a large bowl.
