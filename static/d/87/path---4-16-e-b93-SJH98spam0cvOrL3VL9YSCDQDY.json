As of Friday, I am SORT OF on spring break. While I have an assignment due tomorrow that I am still working on, I've been in California visiting Sumu since Friday!</p>\n<p>While I've buckled down a bit today, Sumu and I spent all of yesterday and this morning running around San Francisco and nearby beaches.</p>\n<p>The soundtrack to our trip?</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3\">\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" wmode=\"Opaque\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vWaRiD5ym74\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>We started off our day at Land's End Recreation Area, which was hands down my favorite part of the trip so far. We parked, and it was about a mile walk to the beach. The entire area was insanely picturesque, and I was half convinced that we had stepped out of San Francisco and into a Lord of the Rings movie.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/x2uo0tras4nbnknlrtbrmqs3jrq69hz0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>From there, we went to get brunch, before heading to Valencia St. to look at street art, before heading to Dolores Park. On the way, we passed the The Women's Building, which has one of the coolest murals I've ever seen on it - if you find yourself in SF, definitely head over there. It's a celebration of women, and it's totally gorgeous.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ov0xg36h85u5eqaz30mfp3ilsw60dxeq.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>After that, we went to Dolores Park and visited the Golden Gate Bridge at sunset!</p>\n<p>Today, we woke up bright and early and headed to Capitola and Natural Bridges State Beach. We wandered around the beach for a while before getting ourselves to our favorite meal: brunch.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/25ppba8otn16vj1tw7nr0naf1xjmglm5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This place was pretty small, but really cute, and had excellent brunch options. I ordered Gallo Pinto, which was described on the menu as a Costa Rican dish.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/hinrb93xbood40avb37ozvuldf5qqbtg.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I liked my dish a lot; the plantains, rice, egg, and sauce went really well together, and I found myself clearing my plate!</p>\n<p>Sumu got the Veggie Cocota, with was veggies and poached eggs covered in a Cocota sauce. Research indicates that Cocota is a neighborhood in Brasil, although I can't speak to the authenticity of the sauce. Either way, it was pretty good; the sauce is quite strong, and while I thought it was delicious, it was a bit much for brunch.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/z6r4ajucixwzwnh3bv2t9bxe5auaf6rg.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Either way, definitely worth a visit.

If you're really digging the song, I totally recommend checking out the entire album. It's a gold mine of amazing songs like &quot;Cheeseburger in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Pencil Thin Mustache&quot;, &quot;Grapefruit - Juicy Fruit&quot;, &quot;Son of a Son of a Sailor&quot;, and last but not least &quot;Why Don't We Get Drunk.&quot; I've linked the entire album here for your enjoyment.

I made these margaritas last year for a Cinco de Mayo celebration at my cousin's place. Technically it was Seis de Mayo because May 5th last year was a Tuesday and everyone was busy that day. These were a HUGE hit and best part is that when you run out of strawberries you can just use more lime juice and make plain margaritas. It's the best.</p>\n<p>In case you needed more convincing to actually listen to that song:</p>\n<p><em>&quot;But there's booze in the blender, and soon it will render that frozen concoction that helps me hang on.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Yeah...

First things first, put your ice cream maker's bowl in the freezer, and chill your coconut milk in the fridge overnight before you start. \n</p><p>\n2.) Put your strawberries, blueberries, juice, and maple syrup into a saucepan and let simmer. When the fruit is about halfway to being complete mush, move to step 3. \n</p><p>\n3.) Crack open your coconut milk and pour into the blender. Add the maple syrup, and carefully remove some of the juice that's in your saucepan, and add it as well. This cuts down on simmering time for the jam, and adds color and flavor to the ice cream! Blend. \n</p><p> \n4.) While the fruit continues to cook, take about 3/4 of the coconut milk you've blended up and put it in a container. Then add the arrowroot or cornstarch, and blend the remaining 1/4 until fully combined. Pour into container with the rest of the coconut milk base. \n</p><p> \n5.) Your fruit should be complete mush now - if there's any juice left, now is the time to slowly pour it into the ice cream base, until there's only a couple of tablespoons of liquid in the saucepan with the fruit. \n</p><p>\n6.) Carefully sprinkle the arrowroot or cornstarch onto the fruit, stirring vigorously to prevent clumping. Allow to cook an additional couple of minutes, until the mixture has thickened just a bit. Remove from heat, and pour into a container. \n</p><p>\n7.) Put the coconut milk base and jam into the fridge - both need to chill for a bit, at least twelve hours, ideally 24 or more. \n</p><p>\n8.) Climb a tree, read a book, explore nature. Go to work? You do you, boo boo. \n</p><p>\n9.) When all ingredients are thoroughly chilled, follow the directions on your ice cream maker! When there are five - ten minutes left, add the jam, and allow to incorporate completely. \n</p><p>\n10.) Eat ice cream in February.

But of course my inner Dory came out and I forgot to upload all the tantalizing pictures I took. A specific friend of mine, <em>cough cough Breane</em>, had requested the recipe so I TOTALLY apologize for my brain fart and promise I'll post it next week! But until then, you'll have to bear with me and enjoy this post instead :).</p>\n<p>So personally, I think my mom is the QUEEN of making banana bread. Like, seriously. Her banana bread the most glorious thing since, well, sliced bread (badum chhhhhhhhh). It's the perfect combination soft and moist and not too sweet. Of course, my banana bread can never live up to that standard but, hey, I can try!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/kvkxvgrndzsbsfjbpa938jq142jrlgpl.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>One thing I've learned about all of my mom's recipes is that her measurements aren't always... Exact. She always shows me measurements using the length of her fingers. Problem is we have different sized hands AND how do you quantify that measurement so that you can replicate it? I've tried SO many times to get teaspoon measurements for everything but can't say I've been entirely successful. This is the sole reason I haven't been able to make my food taste like my mom's food.</p>\n<p>Anyways, a girl can try right? Now back to her mind-BLASTING banana bread.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.meme.am/instances/55172211.jpg\" alt=\"Insert Russell Peters Gif Here\"></p>\n<p>Many of my friends are aware that I don't particularly have a sweet tooth. I mean sure I get cravings on occasion, however, banana bread has always been one of my favorite things, mainly because it's just the right level of sweetness. It has a strong taste of vanilla and of course banana! What could be better?!</p>\n<p>Once when I was having said cravings, I really really wanted to eat my mom's banana bread. So I decided to do my own take on her recipe, I know already going downhill, by adding zucchini and carrot. You know, hiding a little bit of healthy things in there to make you feel better about eating desserts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fk4kesqhxueed5q00j41f9gbjib2vgwo.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It actually came out pretty good, not quite mom level, but still pretty amazing.

You are an incredible friend, which is perhaps one of the best things I could say about a person. I am so lucky to have you in my life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/hbi46on7awfpk8te5ce1o79ai8wn4ju8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Thanks for being my otter watching and blog partner. Thanks for being the Joey to my Chandler, the Ann to my Knope, and the Tina to my Amy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/c5kl7gputj9wtxoxg752vpc90yh51njq.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Also, thanks for being the first of the two of us to not post on her day. It really took the pressure off of me (I think we BOTH thought it would be me!), so thanks. I love you, man.</p>\n<p>In honor of our friendship, Friends, and Valentines Day itself, I made scones. I hope you like them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/alz3hmrfnxx5jg01e9bfshpzuoqjx9jc.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&lt;3 Anu</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Apricot - Pistachio Scones</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>These scones are part whole wheat, part all purpose flour, and I think they would benefit from the addition of a floral note.

I've never used it before, and I found it to be really helpful in keeping the dough together, but a lot of recipes I read didn't use it, and the recipe authors in those cases were fine. \n![](https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zrfxkw1s664clf43v12y5lmefqryahzc.jpg)\n</p></em></p>\n      <p>Yield: 12 scones</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"time\">\n      <p><strong>Total Time:</strong> <span class=\"duration\">1 hour</span></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\"><h4>Scones</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/4 C All Purpose Flour</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">3/4 C Whole Wheat Flour</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 Tsp Cardamom</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/2 Tsp Cinnamon</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">3 Tbsp Sugar </li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">2 Tsp Baking Powder</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">1 Tsp Salt</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">1/3 C Pistachios</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 C Dry Apricots</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">3/4 C Cashews</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">1 Tbsp Xanthan Gum</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">Maple Syrop (for brushing the tops)</li>\n<pre><code>  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;h3 id=&quot;directions&quot;&gt;Directions:&lt;/h3&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n    1.) Preheat the oven to 375 F, and oil/grease a cookie sheet. Put Cashews and Xanthan Gum in a bowl, and add boiling water to submerge cashews. You want to let the cashews hydrate a bit while you're mixing up other stuff.\n</code></pre>\n<p>\n2.) Chop your apricots into bits - 1/4 - 1/2 inch in size, and put them in a bowl. Add boiling water to those too - re-hydrating them keeps them juicy during the baking process. \n</p><p>\n3.) Mix your flours, salt, baking powder, sugar, cardamom, and cinnamon. Make sure all ingredients are fully mixed in. \n</p><p>\n4.) Roughly chop your pistachios, and throw them into the flour. Give it a quick toss to make sure your pistachios are even incorporated. \n</p><p>\n5.) Drain the apricot water into the bowl with cashews and Xanthan gum. Throw the cashews, gum, and some water into the blender. You want it to be the consistency of a thick greek yogurt, so add as much water as you need to get it there, a little bit at a time. \n</p><p>\n6.) Add your apricots to the flour and give it a quick toss, making sure the apricots are even through the dough. \n</p><p>\n7.) Add your cashew mixture a half cup at a time, until the dough is slightly sticky, and shaggy, but holds together. You don't want to over-knead. This is VERY IMPORTANT. DO NOT OVER-KNEAD. \n</p><p>\n8.) Once your dough has just come together, dump it onto a floured surface, and fold it over twice - once top to bottom, flatten out, then from the other side. THAT'S IT. LEAVE IT ALONE. It's done. \n</p><p>\n9.) Form into a disk about 1 - 1/2 inch thick, and cut into whatever shape you want. I went with the classic triangles, but it's up to you. \n</p><p>\n10.) Brush the bottoms with a touch of flour, and the tops with maple syrup. Pop into the oven, and bake for 15 - 20 minutes. I checked on them at 15, and discovered that they needed a bit more time to not be dense and dough-y. \n</p><p> \n11.) Eat piping hot! Slice them open, enjoy them with a bit of additional maple syrup or a pat of butter, and a delicious cup of tea!\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zrfxkw1s664clf43v12y5lmefqryahzc.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d7","name":"scones","slug":"scones"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d8","name":"greatbritishbaking","slug":"greatbritishbaking"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d9","name":"galentinesday","slug":"galentinesday"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2da","name":"valentinesday","slug":"valentinesday"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2db","name":"parksandrecreation","slug":"parksandrecreation"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2dc","name":"leslieknope","slug":"leslieknope"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2dd","name":"leslieandann","slug":"leslieandann"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2de","name":"amypoehler","slug":"amypoehler"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c340","uuid":"279e49d2-aba1-4211-82c1-089cbd2da209","title":"Gaadi Chaats","url":"https://cookinginpjs.herokuapp.com/bread/","published_at":"08 February, 2016","html":"<p>Welcome to another trip to India! When I was there, I ate a ton of food. All of my family members were happy to feed me, and between the amazing home cooking, and the delicious food available on every street corner, it's almost a miracle that I didn't pack on pounds.</p>\n<p>I am, generally, pretty picky about my food. I waver between being vegan and vegetarian, and I'm usually pretty careful about ingredients I allow in my kitchen. But, like everyone else, I have a fatal flaw and it's this; I love street food.</p>\n<p>I know that someone involved didn't wash their hands, I know that the ingredients aren't always top notch, I know that the fat, salt, and sugar content is probably WAY higher than anything I should be consuming. But I don't particularly care.</p>\n<p>In India a &quot;gaadi&quot; is a vehicle, and &quot;chaat&quot; is street food that has fresh vegetable, puffed rice, sweet and spicy sauces, and some fried components. So &quot;gaadi chaat&quot; is street food you get out of a flat bed cart.</p>\n<p>In Bangalore, there's a street people refer to as &quot;chaat street,&quot; and the street is lined with street food vendors. One end has a bakery, and the other end (the end I like to start on) has a few fruit carts, and one &quot;corn&quot; cart. I usually get my corn spiced with salt and chili, and mixed with raw, unripe mangoes (delicious!)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zw9hrme823kt4bmwzy4plu5w9jcwdkmz.jpg\" alt=\"imagine yummy food here, cuz you're missing it!\"></p>\n<p>Then it's time for Masala Chaat! This is one of my absolute favorites; it features a thick, spicy lentil soup layered atop crispy, crackly puris (indian &quot;chips&quot; and under sweet and spicy chutney, some fresh onion and cilantro, and a sprinkle of &quot;chaat masala.&quot;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/gmg1xnscaj3hsaqurjkezft7d1pn8rbj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It's The Chaat Shop!</p>\n<p>Next up: Gobi Manchurian. Cauliflower dipped in dough and deep fried, then dredged in fresh onion and cilantro, and delicious, spicy, tomato-ey garlic-y sauces.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/oolk1yrswjqb9wmq7piboh797nv9lkii.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This is the Gobi Manchurian man! He also makes noodles. He is obviously supremely talented.</p>\n<p>Now that you're ALMOST too full (because you've eaten your way down the street) it's time for dessert! There's a bakery you can step into, vendors with all kinds of sweets and shaved ice, and (my personal favorite) Mango Kulfi!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/g5tfhr9guqtbm7tlinl65rw3eqdczkk8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Go to bed.
