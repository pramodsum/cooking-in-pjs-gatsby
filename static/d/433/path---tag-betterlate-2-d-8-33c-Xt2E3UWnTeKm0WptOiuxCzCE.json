While you are certainly welcome bring booze into\nthe mix, these are instructions for figuring out an all food crawl; it's an\nexcellent way to explore a new city!\n\nIt's also a really good way to spend a couple of hours with friends without\nspending a ton of money; if you're on a budget, this is a great way to try lots\nof different food, and see quite a bit, without breaking the bank. We each paid\nfor one entree at one place, and it came out perfectly for us!\n\nFirst, you need a walkable city. I myself did this with my friends Eden and\nHafsa in San Francisco, the day I last left Sumu.\n\n\n\nSecond, do some preliminary research. Don't actually choose all the places you\nwant to go, but choose 1 or 2, or find a neighborhood that has a ton of stuff\nyou're interested in exploring. We found ourselves wandering around the Mission\nDistrict, ogling wall art and talking about gentrification.\n\nThird, set off on your journey! Start with a place you know you want to go to;\nwe started with Philz Coffee, which also let us sip and wander for a bit before\nwe found real food.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the next several hours, we tried Thai food, Mexican food,\nVietnamese food, and, finally, Ethiopian food. At each place, we would choose\none entree to share, so that in the end, we all got to try tons of yummy food\nfor relatively little!\n\nWe were having so much fun we failed to take a lot of pictures, but this is\ndefinitely one of those days that I'll be remembering for quite a while! If you\ndo a food crawl, let me know how it goes!\n\nAnd, if you're in DC or San Francisco and you're interested in doing this, hit\nSumu or I up! We'd love to have you :)","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ifb3j8uif6p154mugitpvrh06kyjpziu.jpeg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c246","name":"carnivores","slug":"carnivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","name":"eating out","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c235","name":"vietnamese","slug":"vietnamese"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c243","name":"mexican","slug":"mexican"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c250","name":"thai","slug":"thai"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f5","name":"san francisco","slug":"san-francisco"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31b","name":"betterlate","slug":"betterlate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31c","name":"than never","slug":"than-never"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31d","name":"monday","slug":"monday"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31e","name":"food crawl","slug":"food-crawl"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31f","name":"ethiopian","slug":"ethiopian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c320","name":"mission","slug":"mission"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"betterlate","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
