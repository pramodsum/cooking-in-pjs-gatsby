Anytime anyone sees their local Girl Scouts at the grocery\nstore, they start drooling and daydreaming of Thin Mints, Tagalongs, Samoa's,\nand Do-si-Dos. Girl Scout cookies are some of my favorite type of cookies in the\nworld. While I may mainly be a fan of the plain shortbread cookies, Trefoils.\nThin mints and Samoa's are America's two favorites.\n\nWhile plunging into the depths of Pinterest one day, I found a recipe for mini\nsamoa donuts. That got me thinking... What if I were to make mini girl scout\nthemed cupcakes. And to make them even better, give them a slight \"adult\" twist.\n\n\n\nNot to toot my own horn, but these donut bites were AMAZING. Although they were \nreally  donuts... but rather cupcakes. They still tasted great. There was\ndefinitely not enough alcohol in any of the desserts to do any damage but the\nslight bourbon taste in the caramel brought out some awesome flavors.\n\nMy cousins and I even had a hard time not finishing up the caramel bourbon sauce\nbefore the donuts were ready. We kept eating spoon by spoon of the creamy\nbooze-ness.\n\nPro Tip:  Drizzle some warm caramel bourbon sauce onto a scoop of ice cream...\nHEAVEN.\n\nWhen I took these desserts to work, they were gone within minutes. Clearly\neveryone else was dying to get their Girl Scout cookie fix like I was. I even\nsaw this guy spooning caramel bourbon sauce into his coffee to make it a little\nmore \"Irish.\" ;)\n\nHere are the recipes for the donut bites. Even if you don't make the bites\nthemselves... you DEFINITELY have to try the Caramel Bourbon sauce. It takes a\nfew minutes to make and is EXTREMELY rewarding.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamoa Donut Bites\nIngredients:\nDonuts:\n1¼ cup all-purpose flour\n ½ tsp salt\n 1¼ tsp baking powder\n 1 tsp vanilla extract\n 1 egg\n ½ cup milk\n ½ tbsp lemon juice\n 2 tbsp butter, melted\n 4 tbsp Southern Comfort Caramel\n Caramel Bourbon Sauce\n1 package melting caramel (about 14 oz)\n 3 tbsp milk\n ¼ tsp salt\n 2 tbsp Souther Comfort Caramel  <h4>Toppings</h4>\n  <li class=\"ingredient\">3 cups unsweetened coconut flakes, toasted</li>\n</div>\n<div class=\"right\">\n  <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n  <div class=\"instructions\">\n    <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
