Usually that ends up being some simple\npasta, vegetable fajitas, or toppings on a veggie burger. This time, I figured,\nwhy not try something different and make a veggie patty using these vegetables!\n\nIt ended up being some kind of frittata/omelets/burger patty thing. While I may\nnot be entirely sure what to call it, it tasted wonderful. And to my delight, it\nphotographed really well! I actually ate the patty by itself but you could\ndefinitely eat these inside a burger or chopped up in a salad. So many options!\n\n\n\n\n\nQuinoa Veggie Patty\nRecipe inspired by\nhttp://www.halfbakedharvest.com/epic-crispy-quinoa-burgers-topped-sweet-potato-fries-beer-caramelized-onions-gruyere/\n\nIngredients:\n1 cup cooked red quinoa\n 1 cup chopped mushroom\n 1/2 cup sliced zucchini\n 1/2 cup sliced squash\n 1/4 cup sliced red onion\n 1 egg\n 1 handful baby spinach\n 1 tsp red pepper flakes or dash of cayenne\n salt and pepper to taste\n lime slices for garnishing\n chopped green onion for garnishing\n Directions:\nMix all ingredients together and roll into medium-sized balls. Flatten and grill\nthe patties on a Panini press until fully cooked. I used a Panini press because\nI like the lines my burgers get, but feel free to use a skillet. Garnish with a\nfew chopped green onions and enjoy with some Italian dressing!","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8645/16430694707_4453e07de4_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c258","name":"quinoa","slug":"quinoa"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c259","name":"mushroom","slug":"mushroom"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c25a","name":"spinach","slug":"spinach"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c25b","name":"burger","slug":"burger"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c25c","name":"patty","slug":"patty"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"quinoa","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
