Tis a day of celebration. Tis a day of learning.

Here's a look at some of the amazing creations that were submitted!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/nn8d2nka6ctmukq1xfdqmowwwailu5jq.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/rudqvq9eugx628537swax136zz26itbq.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>One of the best things about this competition was that began at exactly 1:59pm. It took me a LONG time until I realized that it was intended to begin at 3/14 1:59, which are the next few digits in pi.</p>\n<p>Once I got over how clutch that was, I began planning what I would bake to enter in this competition. There were tons of categories including best newbie, most creative, best savory, best sweet, etc. I decided I would do something different and make a savory pie, but what to make... THEN I realized I could make Indian savory pies (cover my dinner for a few days) and attempt to blow everyone's minds. I decided to enter 2 pies: a paneer tikka pie and a samosa pie. Yes, I am very well aware that a samosa pie is really just a LARGE samosa, it's just semantics. I have also realized I have watched too much Psych when I use the phrase &quot;it's just semantics&quot; excessively.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://gif.co/rqOE.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Since I decided to experiment so much you guys get TWO recipes this week all wrapped up inside one post. I know we're terrible people who haven't posted in a bit, but I promise we'll make it up to you guys and more. Since I used frozen pie crust, the overall time I spent baking was actually not as long as I had anticipated. I'm not going to write out the whole pie recipe because its fairly generic and you can follow the timings/instructions on the pie crust box itself. I made double crusted pies (where theres crust below and on top of the filling) so I just followed the instructions on the top pie crust box. It was something like this <a href=\"http://www.pillsbury.com/products/pie-crust/refrigerated-pie-crust\">crust</a>, the kind you roll out and lay on top of the pie.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/exwct8krjwx28uvx3j7ksk7g91ey4yp5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There's actually some chicken tikka mini pies in that picture above but that was mainly for myself ;)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/to0z9d01k9mh9k6oawuos5lkkm3ftzrw.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Paneer Tikka Pi(e) Filling</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Uncooked paneer, cubed</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">4 tbsp tandoori masala powder (I really like Kissan Tandoori Masala)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Dahi (curds)</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Mix the tandoori masala and 2-3 large spoons of dahi  together in a large bowl.

I made my first solo move as an adult. I packed up my apartment in Sunnyvale and <em>finally</em> moved to San Francisco. If you're wondering why I picked this specific Van Morrison song, I felt like it was meant to be. The song Saint Dominic's Preview has a lot of references to the Saint Dominic's Church on the intersection of Bush and Steiner in San Francisco, literally a block from my new apartment. Everyday when I walk back from the bus stop after work, I pass by this gorgeous church and admire it. It just felt right to pick this song for the post. :)</p>\n<p>However, if that song isn't your speed and you want something a little more sultry, try this one by Carmen McRae.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:4jsrzfNVVFAtNtMPVpFdwo\" width=\"auto\" max-width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>I've had a blast since moving out here. I get to see my friends almost every day. I have a wonderful new roommate who I've known since college. Even after only a week, I've got to attend all sorts of weird and yet awesome things! This was an art exhibit that was installed right outside City Hall over this past week.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ssreqfxw68u26d0ezcxhj7m41o5rtp8x.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/dzi45k6s5vrfkhd5s4tymemg446eu46v.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>And best of all, I get to cook with my friends, both old and new! I went over to a friend's place yesterday night and me and a new friend, Kerry, began to make some DELICIOUS fresh spring rolls. Granted, the recipe for this has been posted on this site before, the food could never have been more delicious and different. We filled these with lettuce, shrimp, vermicelli noodles, and more! We even made some peanut sauce to dip the rolls in (just mix some hoisin sauce and creamy peanut butter together). Simple, yet delicious!</p>\n<p>We did have some mishaps during the process. San Francisco kitchens are usually TINY, as are a lot of the apartments. My friend's kitchen is very much sizable for 1 person cooking. When you try to squeeze 4 people in there, chaos ensues.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We were lied to about the presence of peanut butter, hence sending the boys on one trip to the store</li>\n<li>Kerry and I weren't aware that the pasta strainer LOCKED onto the pot we were cooking the noodles in. This unfortunately caused ALL of the noodles to fall into the sink, hence a second trip to the store to get more noodles</li>\n<li>The boys may never let us live this down. Highly unlikely after all the sass given while Kerry and I made their dinner.</li>\n<li>They showed me this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y7Vq9749s8\">amazing group that performs acoustic covers of popular songs</a>... MIND BLOWING. I'm not gonna lie I may have teared up a bit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While I may not have an explicit recipe for you, I have plenty of photos and full stomachs as proof.
