Sorry for the brief and awkward hiatus; it was certainly\nnot our intention, and won't be happening again! Sumu was moving, and I was\nletting law school rain on my parade. But we're back now!\n\n\n\nSumu's all settled into her new apartment in the city, and while law school is\nstill kicking my ass, I've decided to chill out. Law school itself was never the\npoint, and forgetting that is the number one cause of stress for me.\n\nSo, we're kicking off our triumphant return with a throwback recipe. When I got\nto California to visit Sumu, we made fresh rolls. I'll be honest and say that I\ndon't know the difference between a spring roll and a fresh roll. What I do know\nis that fresh rolls, full of bright, delicious veggies and sauces, feel like\nspring time to me.\n\n\n\nThis recipe is easily customizable, for which reason there are no specific\nquantities in the recipe. Do what your heart tells you. Go with your gut. Feel\nout your local grocer and figure out what you can get in what quantities.\n\nSpring is finally here, and while spring break has long since passed, these\nrolls will pretty much always be in season.\n\nSpring Rolls\nThese are the best way to deliver a quick, one two punch of veggies to yo' bod.\nYour mouth and your stomach deserve this meal. This is a pretty sexy recipe,\nwith all the crisp, fresh veggies, the sharp kick from the sriracha and the\nsilky sweetness of hoisin, with some big fresh basil leaves bringing it full\ncircle...I'm drooling just thinking about it! \n\nYield: negotiable\n\nTotal Time:  45 minutes\n\nIngredients:\nComponent 1\nRice paper sheets. Can be found at Asian groceries\n Fresh basil leavesBok choyCarrotsCilantroBeetsBean sproutsHoisin SauceSriracha\nSauceTofuAlfalfa sprouts\n Directions:\n\n1.) Prepare your vegetables. Slice your carrots into matchsticks, steam your bok\nchoy, saute the beets, cook your tofu how you like (we did fried tofu sauted in\nbarbecue sauce) and rinse your bean sprouts, before arranging everything in\nbowls around your workstation.\n\n\n2.) Set a shallow plate full of hot water beside you, and take out a rice paper\nsheet. Dip it into the water for ten seconds, and then lay it out on a cutting\nboard.\n\n\n3.) Layer your veggies and tofu in a mound in the middle of the sheet, then\ndrizzle sauces over it. Fold the two sides over, then roll smoothly from top to\nbottom.\n\n\n4.) Enjoy. Delicious!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/7d95dkz95g5gdrlfsv8xdqd6bp2yxbic.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f3","name":"spring break","slug":"spring-break"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c30e","name":"spring rolls","slug":"spring-rolls"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c30f","name":"fresh rolls","slug":"fresh-rolls"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c310","name":"rice paper","slug":"rice-paper"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c311","name":"basil","slug":"basil"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c269","name":"sriracha","slug":"sriracha"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c371","uuid":"c29b2ef2-5742-41db-8c7d-ee40d863ac36","title":"California Gurrrrllllll","slug":"california-gurrrrllllll","published_at":"29 February, 2016","plaintext":"Spring break baby! As of Friday, I am SORT OF on spring break. While I have an\nassignment due tomorrow that I am still working on, I've been in California\nvisiting Sumu since Friday!\n\nWhile I've buckled down a bit today, Sumu and I spent all of yesterday and this\nmorning running around San Francisco and nearby beaches.\n\nThe soundtrack to our trip?\n\nWe started off our day at Land's End Recreation Area, which was hands down my\nfavorite part of the trip so far. We parked, and it was about a mile walk to the\nbeach. The entire area was insanely picturesque, and I was half convinced that\nwe had stepped out of San Francisco and into a Lord of the Rings movie.\n\n\n\nFrom there, we went to get brunch, before heading to Valencia St. to look at\nstreet art, before heading to Dolores Park. On the way, we passed the The\nWomen's Building, which has one of the coolest murals I've ever seen on it - if\nyou find yourself in SF, definitely head over there. It's a celebration of\nwomen, and it's totally gorgeous.\n\n\n\nAfter that, we went to Dolores Park and visited the Golden Gate Bridge at\nsunset!\n\nToday, we woke up bright and early and headed to Capitola and Natural Bridges\nState Beach. We wandered around the beach for a while before getting ourselves\nto our favorite meal: brunch.\n\n\n\nThis place was pretty small, but really cute, and had excellent brunch options.\nI ordered Gallo Pinto, which was described on the menu as a Costa Rican dish.\n\n\n\nI liked my dish a lot; the plantains, rice, egg, and sauce went really well\ntogether, and I found myself clearing my plate!\n\nSumu got the Veggie Cocota, with was veggies and poached eggs covered in a\nCocota sauce. Research indicates that Cocota is a neighborhood in Brasil,\nalthough I can't speak to the authenticity of the sauce. Either way, it was\npretty good; the sauce is quite strong, and while I thought it was delicious, it\nwas a bit much for brunch.\n\n\n\nEither way, definitely worth a visit. If you're in Santa Cruz, definitely head\nover; they also have fresh juice that's perfect for taking with you to the\nbeach!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/hinrb93xbood40avb37ozvuldf5qqbtg.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c26c","name":"california","slug":"california"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f1","name":"besties","slug":"besties"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f2","name":"visits","slug":"visits"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f3","name":"spring break","slug":"spring-break"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f4","name":"santa cruz","slug":"santa-cruz"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f5","name":"san francisco","slug":"san-francisco"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f6","name":"land's end","slug":"lands-end"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f8","name":"natural bridges","slug":"natural-bridges"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f7","name":"the shire","slug":"the-shire"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f9","name":"golden gate","slug":"golden-gate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fa","name":"the women's center","slug":"the-womens-center"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fb","name":"cafe brasil","slug":"cafe-brasil"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"spring-break","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
