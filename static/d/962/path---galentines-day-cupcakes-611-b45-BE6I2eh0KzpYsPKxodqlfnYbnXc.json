No one could have answered that question better than Amy Poehler herself, &quot;it's only the best day of the year. Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home, and we just come and kick it, breakfast-style. Ladies celebrating ladies. It's like Lilith Fair, minus the angst. Plus frittatas.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ever year on Valentine's Day, my mom sends me a special gift. When I lived it at home, she used to give me and my brother cute small stuffed animals with hearts on them. When I moved to Ann Arbor for college, she took a different approach. Every year, she would send me a heart shaped pizza with my favorite toppings, MUSHROOMS!</p>\n<p>This past Valentine's Day, however, I was in India so neither was possible. So my cousins and I decided to celebrate Galentine's Day instead! We made some delicious red velvet cupcakes from scratch, enjoyed some leftover batter, and watched some light hearted chick flicks. All in all, a great way to celebrate our fellow ladies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8625/16587351126_1c46565bdc_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We were pretty lazy about experimenting with the recipe so I will just leave you with <a href=\"http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2014/10/29/red-velvet-cupcakes/\">the recipe we used</a> for the cupcakes and made a basic chocolate icing following the instructions on the bag of confectioners sugar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/16587382106_5c03caf20b_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8562/16426167478_8bc9ab2160_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8652/16612747142_14252b62a0_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&quot;February 14th, Valentine's Day, is about romance. But February 13th, Galentine's Day, is about celebrating lady friends.

One of my favorite bands, Train, partnered with a California winery to make a line of wines named after some of their most famous songs! What could be better than that!</p>\n<p>This was a great wine for me and my friends, especially because we all have different preferences when it comes to wine. I prefer a really deep spicy red, whereas most of my friends like drier whites or dessert wines. Surprisingly, this wine solved most of our dilemmas. Each glass is smooth, sweet and spicy, but doesn't lean too far in either direction. It has something for all shades of wine lovers! (Plus it doesn't hurt that it's under $10) It's a college wine lover's dream! :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8782/17033305629_16faa89701_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Drops of Jupiter is not even the only type of wine that the Save Me San Francisco Wine Co makes. They also make Calling All Angels, California 37, Bulletproof Picasso, Hella Fine, and Soul Sister.</p>\n<p>Just pour yourself a glass, blast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xf-Lesrkuc\">Drops of Jupiter</a>, and take a trip back to the 90's!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m33pmsMyUY1qflcm5o1_500.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"Did you fall for a shooting star?","slug":"did-you-fall-for-a-shooting-star","published_at":"21 April, 2015","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8782/17033305629_16faa89701_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c242","slug":"giggle-juice"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c247","slug":"wine"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c248","slug":"drops-of-jupiter"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c249","slug":"train"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c24a","slug":"red-wine"}]},"next":{"html":"<p>First of all, Dirty Dancing Havana Nights is one of my favorite movies.

However last month when me and my family went to Cancun for a week, I knew I had been missing out on something big. The amazing flavors of corn tortillas, super flavorful meat (or beans for you vegetarians), fresh salsas and Crema Mexicana mesh together for a completely different experience of eating simple tacos. Now that I had officially been converted to a taco snob, I was determined to only eat the best of tacos I could find.</p>\n<p>Conveniently the bay area is filled with the most amazing food, especially when it comes to taco trucks. Each taco truck I've visited usually has a side of a few salsas. I was determined to recreate two of my favorite taco truck salsas, an avocado tomatillo salsa and a spicy red chili salsa, as authentic as possible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8743/17335026415_ff5458c370_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I found a few recipes online, and experimented on my own and finally ended up with these recipes!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7661/17327373531_b39d8028ec_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Avocado Tomatillo Salsa</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to adjust the number of chilis based on your own spice tolerance.
