Anytime anyone sees their local Girl Scouts at the grocery store, they start drooling and daydreaming of Thin Mints, Tagalongs, Samoa's, and Do-si-Dos. Girl Scout cookies are some of my favorite type of cookies in the world. While I may mainly be a fan of the plain shortbread cookies, Trefoils. Thin mints and Samoa's are America's two favorites.</p>\n<p>While plunging into the depths of Pinterest one day, I found a recipe for mini samoa donuts. That got me thinking... What if I were to make mini girl scout themed cupcakes. And to make them even better, give them a slight &quot;adult&quot; twist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LVZHqaB-oL-fVWQXFOi2BHG5JYGj8Y-hcensdE9O9mSA=w1312-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Not to toot my own horn, but these donut bites were <em>AMAZING</em>. Although they were <em>really</em> donuts... but rather cupcakes. They still tasted great. There was definitely not enough alcohol in any of the desserts to do any damage but the slight bourbon taste in the caramel brought out some awesome flavors.</p>\n<p>My cousins and I even had a hard time not finishing up the caramel bourbon sauce before the donuts were ready. We kept eating spoon by spoon of the creamy booze-ness.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Drizzle some warm caramel bourbon sauce onto a scoop of ice cream... HEAVEN.</p>\n<p>When I took these desserts to work, they were gone within minutes. Clearly everyone else was dying to get their Girl Scout cookie fix like I was. I even saw this guy spooning caramel bourbon sauce into his coffee to make it a little more &quot;Irish.&quot; ;)</p>\n<p>Here are the recipes for the donut bites. Even if you don't make the bites themselves... you DEFINITELY have to try the Caramel Bourbon sauce. It takes a few minutes to make and is EXTREMELY rewarding.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BYvxNbTPOJb518dtM6jLTZ9gwTDpQpmuj15u6oPPormA=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pk7bQdao45MiJPXztLw3P1jt6yLFAw5g-mIGogM4G2O5=w1458-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Samoa Donut Bites</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <h4>Donuts:</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ tsp baking powder</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ cup milk</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ tbsp lemon juice</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp butter, melted</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">4 tbsp Southern Comfort Caramel</li>\n      <h4>Caramel Bourbon Sauce</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 package melting caramel (about 14 oz)</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">3 tbsp milk</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp Souther Comfort Caramel</li>\n<pre><code>  &lt;h4&gt;Toppings&lt;/h4&gt;\n  &lt;li class=&quot;ingredient&quot;&gt;3 cups unsweetened coconut flakes, toasted&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;h3 id=&quot;directions&quot;&gt;Directions:&lt;/h3&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

A lot of people attended and learned a lot about what Box is doing to improve the gender disparity in tech. Sadly, we overestimated how much granola we needed and ended up with 2 GIANT bowls of granola left over.</p>\n<p>In my head, it seemed like I could bake those into some variety of oatmeal cookies and breakfast bars and be done with it. No matter how much granola I used, it seemed like it was never going to end! Thankfully after making 3-4 batches of these oatmeal bars I finished 1 bowl, but I ended up making some dark chocolate fruit and nut clusters as well (post coming soon).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sGP7DG-ogISOqpn5cRBPGfuyssXcg4RgvQrrHS9UhVFMELUH4_UZmo210YRzTkLpdPGWv5x2ZFM4jExGZQWfocYpQGZdZiHKQEKg_pqMyhN-So95F9-dypl_FJpWELhBfs86l7Rrk3qWGPTpStQ2mG0CXPGYFOdcO6eQmaDVSSRKcHBhyWGXjPdALsaiblUo92stdgRYxOSGCk7Mti2VVkQekoIIf1z_qxwYD63gjXrQUKzap7dodLYFyONtcohBmOK4iEFcCs5Y3Wtl9J9J8dw6uZzJ1qLmDI_OT7Pt_vGAgDYXeQC-C_jAD4BBiIS4jJUAr-Auuh75uxjDm6RsGFl211_fuQ91zKMO-DMCW_i3H6tQHGCUpGDbuFNID-Tf5BZDIAiCIom05iwRRAt9I5CU6tx_e_Ppjj7dBAiKOLOCQA96jWOUdFkqw5ClRrZ7xvmdX9OR_Odhx-04FI6_Ugi9BPUFpx24NvgIuaOiQc6efIcEYOwsOWtycdKE1xhIjAo613H3h9zv3EUO09L8M1DSPgixNHUwMZwr6aOdOl1r=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In all honesty, these cookie bars were SO much better than those chocolate clusters (as scrumptious as those look). The crumbly-ness and chocolatey-ness of these bars complemented each other perfectly. I've actually saved all the extra crumbles to top ice scream sundaes. Think about how delicious that would be!!! Now that you're officially drooling thinking about that, here's the recipe.</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie Bars</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">3 cups granola (or oats)</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup butter, melted</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 cups chocolate chips</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 cups flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1½ cups brown sugar</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp baking soda</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1½ tbsp vanilla</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 eggs</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray.</p>\n        <p>Add everything but the chocolate chips into a bowl and mix until just combined. I don't have a standing mixer or this would have been much easier and less messier. Stir in the chocolate chips.</p>\n        <p>Spread the batter into the baking dish. Bake for 25 minutes or until a tester comes out with just a few moist crumbs. Bars should look slightly underdone. Let cool 1 hour before cutting into bars. (But let's be honest here... I couldn't wait more than 10 minutes)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Because the granola I used wasn't very sweet it didn't overly sweeten the bars either, which was something I preferred. Similarly, using brown sugar instead of normal granular sugar kept the bars less sweet. Make sure not to overcook the bars or they won't be as gloriously crumbly!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uQrAyDivSMbcmNtvHNBFu_QdSkQPcf2sZgjnRyK68wk8V9SYj8q2L4Zjl6gG2qsOnHao_a5nTKX9qm7T76p6eGY5ZaLABI6SBgCxTsdh3grdS_IvVj2xMRqvp7A5oX8ZksEX80b_6stHwWjiPs-kz014FANeFRWv8x8icGwd0wJ5w7s_hWQnEAEwUiEEX91_Uxb0SxlNsXJTbhlCoCqh_HyxKUJRmoR5LQ9LcTF87CSBz2rFfQHLlgZC1qk61bVwoSy_YnlFKVR5Izcx3yPmu2vp0zx183nfiNmZdKbJ60mc8Jm_jlmk1Z-KtqmdAVSxaFZ6sqtPOsggjwXEZIH0hFHZOPhgX6zfyzH_vLQ0tWPQa1OUAmMOWp_zm3-3umJ1tGTifgjs0RlrqxiuTWfjfSr8POYttNJSh7m1DzHRT5prbidF1SQIYAMJfzUIKJlA7nprMc_VraNXjf3ZRFTbirubqyuNvj3CQAU4OTHchOAfTg0JLIrqD82Od4P5RNHn8UvUSACLgNkiWC6H4NIhZPsyiS-dqiNk2xSa7HROpk_K=w1440-h1080-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mUbMEZZQ3oGBxeqw6y0s1Ee_WGOWWcNnZ3zeRT0ExYBdCKJNgdcj3PNwxOxBf8Pt1eBEcr-bRArg7ZtA-hrAh3IEfd1avJxPewZ2QooCl9ibPMd4zcTEmQVjd0FDpLWCwqhZdtCCC0mmMk3AD7UF8n_WINUEybW63C8CE0ttVFJzdD4edmr4H-3BapJLd2kRdfG5ifRodUO5KkZsLcQtcGUbTYIDJWzs3J4Ijb-G5Ax80OQdgHLlhjUSpGJ9uQNJ_-JkpgypKRGE5OpK3_OFAqYOq_AYQvaEkz9WmOUeLjI_n4kXlJGUjiu5-rybvT7Oswc8iSxqedjskMlFZFfCmL1A_K3ZRx7foBC8s1gdnigzUJU48Dw7lPCjp9-7Gz3VaBeq6bdzQL-HurwFbxwUF16k5yxvZ_h1tett6jpaiADX5frvd9ZTK8TdSqWdGsnbT8zNLLSBPRYYeuOZWxp45HL-kZrYaqcvBBaa900-A4BQFzmUzP6KO8PsfOlieW3lzVG_fUrXacU4JlYCdLBa7q2_YSoh_GMFX5HEwCX23nSo=w1440-h1080-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"What to do when you have the World's Supply of Granola at your Disposal","slug":"what-to-do-when-you-have-the-worlds-supply-of-granola-at-your-disposal","published_at":"08 October, 2015","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2lPmzUu82FpK-bF10uC-AJpZ8xIWniOm2cCYIRfno-lDDrHJp5zBVeNAPCaaBZMwDVZ_wv9-tiO4OVMUyv90BGrb3cpDcawOhIjnkkM5FtDsXUzWoa9hfnflZZ7wgFq13L44Si8-D4RHJ17O8KP8aKIOKPDpYr_MbISDtZtCZh9enMUhh-1esqJO16NL8-suXV6hO6JlMnyzjQwFNeww9sUlZuwprBxko5kC1YvUsa1Vk69b02093F_4JuCdlWORn_SJA97gLJzvlnDVI3HIZYQ41o0e2JJA0SEdMgv9PRki8xj4fJtI_E2W_DdiYKPg3AulAqqO0Qx9i9q9pMjUZEiNmjzAFa_BcAWYSPRb27EM8s8BujPmrAWM8AxNpE2mjd0OJRddfyJlkVXZyu0j6PJizFjtEP43x6uSPcgL5SrNdACc4g8EVrth-qPHxy2eOnhYgEtc-wR80827fG_pKrzy8nwUfVmIEMbtOHRf1zD06ZNVPjqADJ8CSbxv5vOAP-DZNKtUnK4AViSQA8OpchyEQRquO5A8NeFuN9qKZLez=w1440-h1080-no","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c28b","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29e","slug":"oatmeal"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29f","slug":"granola"}]}}}
