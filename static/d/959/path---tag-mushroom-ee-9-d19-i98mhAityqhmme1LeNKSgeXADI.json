I love the original song by Zella Day but this mix\nis also amazing. Enjoy!\n\nEver since I was a kid, I was always that weird one who LOVED spinach. All my\nfriends would fight and complain but I would ALWAYS ask for more. I know. I was\nthat kid. I was also that kid who would happily drink a glass of plain milk\nevery day. Anyways... I love spinach. Whenever I used to make omelets for my\nmom, she used to complain that she could never find the egg because I had\noverloaded it with so much spinach.\n\nSo when I was living alone in Sunnyvale, I decided one week I was going to be\nsuper healthy and make meals filled with tons of vegetables. Obviously, this\nbeing me, ended up just an obscene amount of spinach and mushrooms. That's about\nit.\n\n\n\nThis recipe is super easy and delicious. Plus it barely takes any time to make!\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\nSpinach Avocado Crostini\nIngredients:\n1 sourdough baguette\na few handfuls baby spinach leaves\n 2 handfuls mushrooms, sliced\n Component 2\n1/4 red onion, diced\n 1 Avocado, diced in larger chunks\n Balsamic Vinaigrette\n Directions:\nMix the avocado chunks with some balsamic vinaigrette in a bowl and keep to the\nside.\n\nSauté the red onions, mushrooms, and spinach in some more balsamic vinaigrette\nor red wine (your choice ;) ) until the spinach has wilted and the mushrooms\nlook like they have been cooked through.\n\nSlice the baguette and top with the avocados and spinach mixtures. Enjoy!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/s87a60v38mfk5xbloe2r5i0ftvajj24h.png","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c26f","name":"avocado","slug":"avocado"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c25a","name":"spinach","slug":"spinach"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c259","name":"mushroom","slug":"mushroom"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c334","name":"crostini","slug":"crostini"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c335","name":"snack","slug":"snack"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c336","name":"sourdough","slug":"sourdough"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c374","uuid":"e33aab41-f24a-4fd2-a9db-938e0ec44ff7","title":"I Quinoa Believe It's a Veggie Patty","slug":"quinoa-veggie-burger","published_at":"27 March, 2015","plaintext":"\n\nWhenever I'm home, my mom sometimes sautés some vegetables and keeps them for me\nto use with whatever I make for lunch. Usually that ends up being some simple\npasta, vegetable fajitas, or toppings on a veggie burger. This time, I figured,\nwhy not try something different and make a veggie patty using these vegetables!\n\nIt ended up being some kind of frittata/omelets/burger patty thing. While I may\nnot be entirely sure what to call it, it tasted wonderful. And to my delight, it\nphotographed really well! I actually ate the patty by itself but you could\ndefinitely eat these inside a burger or chopped up in a salad. So many options!\n\n\n\n\n\nQuinoa Veggie Patty\nRecipe inspired by\nhttp://www.halfbakedharvest.com/epic-crispy-quinoa-burgers-topped-sweet-potato-fries-beer-caramelized-onions-gruyere/\n\nIngredients:\n1 cup cooked red quinoa\n 1 cup chopped mushroom\n 1/2 cup sliced zucchini\n 1/2 cup sliced squash\n 1/4 cup sliced red onion\n 1 egg\n 1 handful baby spinach\n 1 tsp red pepper flakes or dash of cayenne\n salt and pepper to taste\n lime slices for garnishing\n chopped green onion for garnishing\n Directions:\nMix all ingredients together and roll into medium-sized balls. Flatten and grill\nthe patties on a Panini press until fully cooked. I used a Panini press because\nI like the lines my burgers get, but feel free to use a skillet. Garnish with a\nfew chopped green onions and enjoy with some Italian dressing!","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8645/16430694707_4453e07de4_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c258","name":"quinoa","slug":"quinoa"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c259","name":"mushroom","slug":"mushroom"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c25a","name":"spinach","slug":"spinach"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c25b","name":"burger","slug":"burger"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c25c","name":"patty","slug":"patty"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"mushroom","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
