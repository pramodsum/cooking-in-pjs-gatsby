It I guess technically was macarons but i wasn't able to get the perfect bubble shape. I was determined to perfect this recipe!</p>\n<p>THE MACARONS CANNOT WIN!</p>\n<p>So I set out to make batch 3. This time I let the egg whites &quot;age&quot; for a few days before using them. And I decided that I would try to be patient and actually wait for the meringue to be COMPLETELY done. I had gotten closer last time but not enough.</p>\n<p>What basically followed was me obsessively watching videos on how to make the perfect macarons. (I've provided some of those links here) My cousin literally thought I was insane because I watched videos for a good hour (okay maybe it was actually 2 hours... don't judge me).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://foodnouveau.com/destinations/europe/france/how-to-make-macarons-a-detailed-illustrated-step-by-step-recipe/\">http://foodnouveau.com/destinations/europe/france/how-to-make-macarons-a-detailed-illustrated-step-by-step-recipe/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foodiebaker.com/chocolate-macarons/\">http://www.foodiebaker.com/chocolate-macarons/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bri6xnDBl9I\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bri6xnDBl9I</a></p>\n<p>There are also TONS of other videos on youtube but let's be honest here... how many of you will actually be attempting to make these.

WAY too much effort in my opinion.</p>\n<p>However, they were quite tasty. Nicely crunchy yet light. We slathered some peanut butter and munched on a few macaron, or I guess in my case macaron-adjacents.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iOCibvCoZE8a1-lZfTuq58-efARuocQUpkjoBY3hg9Mj=w1996-h1498-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rqfEl9XDGtpP-gwzIITnumxEeg3G0Gc0CWxCdS8SpKSj=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>(Yes yes I know I spelled it wrong...

And I figured if I made them all blue and yellow then all the better... GO BLUE! I looked at the recipe, saw the ingredients and was confident that this dessert was within my range of baking abilities. In fact, I was SO confident that I called a friend of mine to come over and reap the benefits of my baking!</p>\n<p>Clearly such confidence could only yield brilliant results.</p>\n<p><strong>WRONG</strong></p>\n<p>Making macarons is a very delicate process that requires a lot more patience and skill than I had ever anticipated! And for that very reason, the adorable macarons I had been picturing in my head came out like this.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JjfOtdZpKGPUnJWQXW5VSqnS-09Xoi1kbel7l62Q72S2=w1756-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Exactly like you picture macarons in French Patisseries right?! I know... I was just as disappointed as you. It basically became some strange almond flavored fruit roll ups. Not at all appetizing. Now there was another problem... I had a <strong>TON</strong> of almond batter that clearly wasn't going to make macarons and no idea what to do with it. My cousin saved my ass and suggested I just convert them into almond cupcakes.</p>\n<p>Honestly, I think it was my disappointment at failing to make macrons but I half heartedly made these cupcakes. So much so that I didn't even bother with my usual photo shoot of the final masterpiece. I have absolutely no photos of what they turned out to look like. Nada. Zilch. But imagine they looked something like this except light yellow and blue with little almond specs all inside.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.afarmgirlsdabbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/530_IMG_7507_white-cupcakes.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>They weren't especially sweet cupcakes so I figured they needed some kind of topping to balance out the flavors. I went back and made some of my handy caramel bourbon sauce, which is just melted caramel, a little water, and some <a href=\"http://www.southerncomfort.com/age?ref=caramel\">Caramel Southern Comfort</a>. First off, it's heavenly and just a little boozy. Secondly, it basically takes you 2 minutes to make.</p>\n<p>Finally having somewhat salvaged this disaster, I took the box of what I thought was my failures to work. After keeping it out in the lounge area, I quickly learned that the combination of almond cupcakes with caramel bourbon sauce works.... like <strong>really</strong> works.</p>\n<p>Anyways, here's what I think was the makeshift cupcake recipe. More or less...</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>\"Macaron\" Almond Cupcakes</h2>\n    <em>If the consistency doesn't seem like normal cupcake batter, add more flour.

Anytime anyone sees their local Girl Scouts at the grocery store, they start drooling and daydreaming of Thin Mints, Tagalongs, Samoa's, and Do-si-Dos. Girl Scout cookies are some of my favorite type of cookies in the world. While I may mainly be a fan of the plain shortbread cookies, Trefoils. Thin mints and Samoa's are America's two favorites.</p>\n<p>While plunging into the depths of Pinterest one day, I found a recipe for mini samoa donuts. That got me thinking... What if I were to make mini girl scout themed cupcakes. And to make them even better, give them a slight &quot;adult&quot; twist.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LVZHqaB-oL-fVWQXFOi2BHG5JYGj8Y-hcensdE9O9mSA=w1312-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Not to toot my own horn, but these donut bites were <em>AMAZING</em>. Although they were <em>really</em> donuts... but rather cupcakes. They still tasted great. There was definitely not enough alcohol in any of the desserts to do any damage but the slight bourbon taste in the caramel brought out some awesome flavors.</p>\n<p>My cousins and I even had a hard time not finishing up the caramel bourbon sauce before the donuts were ready. We kept eating spoon by spoon of the creamy booze-ness.</p>\n<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Drizzle some warm caramel bourbon sauce onto a scoop of ice cream... HEAVEN.</p>\n<p>When I took these desserts to work, they were gone within minutes. Clearly everyone else was dying to get their Girl Scout cookie fix like I was. I even saw this guy spooning caramel bourbon sauce into his coffee to make it a little more &quot;Irish.&quot; ;)</p>\n<p>Here are the recipes for the donut bites. Even if you don't make the bites themselves... you DEFINITELY have to try the Caramel Bourbon sauce. It takes a few minutes to make and is EXTREMELY rewarding.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/BYvxNbTPOJb518dtM6jLTZ9gwTDpQpmuj15u6oPPormA=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pk7bQdao45MiJPXztLw3P1jt6yLFAw5g-mIGogM4G2O5=w1458-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Samoa Donut Bites</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <h4>Donuts:</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ tsp baking powder</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ cup milk</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">½ tbsp lemon juice</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp butter, melted</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">4 tbsp Southern Comfort Caramel</li>\n      <h4>Caramel Bourbon Sauce</h4>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 package melting caramel (about 14 oz)</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">3 tbsp milk</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp Souther Comfort Caramel</li>\n<pre><code>  &lt;h4&gt;Toppings&lt;/h4&gt;\n  &lt;li class=&quot;ingredient&quot;&gt;3 cups unsweetened coconut flakes, toasted&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;h3 id=&quot;directions&quot;&gt;Directions:&lt;/h3&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
