Despite his many divorces and nerdy dinosaur quirks, Dr. Gellar (no not that kind of doctor) was one of my favorite characters on Friends. Every time I make fajitas I remember Ross absolutely &quot;NOT&quot; being weird about Joey and Rachel starting to go out.

I can't even begin to count the endless number of illegally uploaded episodes I've watched on YouTube with Spanish subtitles. I ended up learning various inappropriate words through context.

So this January when I was in India, my cousin had major cravings for Mexican food. We decided to enhance our existing Galentine's Day plans from just <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/galentines-day-cupcakes/\">red velvet cupcakes</a> to include some simple yet delicious Mexican food.</p>\n<p>A lot of the parts of this recipe have already been posted in other posts, so I'm just going to link those rather than retyping. I just sautéd a some spinach, bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms with my own <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/estoy-cantando/\">fajita seasoning</a> recipe. Added some corn salsa and <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/taco-tuesday/\">homemade sour cream</a> and <a href=\"http://cookinginpjs.com/taco-tuesday/\">flour tortillas</a>.

Being the ever so responsible adult that I am, I decided that I could muster enough patience to cook lunches and dinners for my brother a few times, or at least while I was working from home. We braved it out to a farmers market and brought back a collection of various vegetables without any idea of what to make. While brainstorming ideas my brother decided that since he was spending a week in California, he was going to try and eat Mexican food for each and every meal.</p>\n<p>My next step was to figure out what kind of Mexican dish to make when all I had bought was stir fry vegetables. Voilà! MEXICAN &quot;STIR FRY&quot;! Or I guess as normal people call it... TOSTADA BOWLS!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ve6cm0UWi2klfKNBucW5RQaGauUXPwneEc0sHfvpURDlY3SWKBfcYAQLCJK3Q2I7uSZdo2ulwfO1mmXmKWbZ56btcUQ7m3i5eay2g4qi-f4FaQtX-vYoiSZHueaiJjhMGIWs-sVJY68eBCXO2Aj5ctKAmXCHAKEriVCYSAMdo4ThgSXyixQxiO7-FNwcDa9fhjyVdSm2euwAOJC3l92hTmva72-XsHiX4ir8ElyAZFpvOS9nQ1j0kDCzfx0J4nYPfKAzJp7wDVWQUkQsDW90frbjnFfpEeUw_gl_n2DzR7x9r5tbjC4I9M1OqHmlgp-mhJZ46I8L2olUEqEcXkvcRiVPJFNlfMJyx4YRU5KPR8G921KOOy_0l_68mWlZSdTlIH6-De6xwXGCL9lR2sQ-CIxdIFGumGYlH35G8I8bo2GHZw5eG2org0oKpi0QYd8373sOFzMMElqSdAKsatEayenx7iGKBPLngoAK3m5cH5b7IxHHymlLi-baaZRFwgiqMqyiH2l7xu2htVeC_zTfpPjJNr-_0eDiAJmh1I5pEykrD5Sy44vuiUjnbicZMeTC4hn_tg=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There's not really a recipe for this post because honestly I kind of made it up on the spot. BUT I can give you some bits and pieces of what went in this so you can make your own variation of this dish at home! (I KNOW, how sweet of me.)</p>\n<p>This dish is essentially a layer of cilantro lime rice, refried beans, vegetables sautéd fajita style, salmon (totally optional and honestly kinda ruined the dish for me, my brother's vegetarian one was on point), guacamole, sour cream and cotija cheese a.k.a. fancy Mexican cheese. Plus you can throw some chopped green onions on top to make it look all pretty and fancy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CeNqsYp63uvCaplae3zBaDNLdex2SHlc0IMJSkMjUmFjsv59YL92AaEDRfHi6nIko0QnXSz8DBH81h1C0rvKzWi4GatpUqH3aT2QXl1ws6cH6QqprP6Enh2oNuG2VegDD94fbVobszPLMNhKqMw-CsTpJcyjH-Jb8hvmJNfmalrGrUhGVZZijJBAUM-IAE5sFkFBPRHdDtdLBMV_DZh7VHm40qWDhdQyzu7RJd_uGhmOcecFMuvr8zlSlx8G4zotPn2E6qRxUpExV8JHKsbZAlpB443QUuMVdJ6gHjR3xgp_3YOaxY2lopHf19vQ7x7oJHe5UaFqRrLK1eVUBETrB_Jc1dmWJS-LVOk8f6mjkbJt0v01VmxHTdw5HmvikvgTOXPTN5ha0w-VX1KhLxd5hohLEGei2FNAc_gCX1cZWzmxiy2uj6vZoeqKDg8VQgjYJGTbzmHKenzKWsI0GfX4wd0wcsMlEWcETm0_t8A6aFXQpXuw5im8BxIPfd-csF8tzSGUEKVCwkl1KahFAkwEeLPtMCmxhlSo1I-m91MXYv7aVws1Diu8quyH-ZLVcE5jzXzO6A=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I've always loved making Mexican food. It's so flavorful and deliciously rewarding every time! Every single part of a burrito/taco/bowl is overflowing with unique tastes that seem extremely complicated and intricate. I'll let you in on a little secret...I use the same seasoning to cook every single part of any Mexican dish I make. Whether it be the refried beans or fajita vegetables, it's all various spice levels of the same recipe. I'm sure that's not how authentic Mexican food is made, but hey...mine tastes pretty damn good too.</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Sumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to mess around with the proportions of each ingredient!

Sometimes I add some cumin or replace the jalapeños with cayenne pepper if I'm feeling dangerous. To go off on a tangent, couldn't you watch this gif of guacamole being made forever? 1) I feel really bad for/impressed by the person who disrobed all those avocados and 2) I just want to dive into that bowl tongue first.

Just sauté the vegetables of your choosing with some oil and fajita seasoning, heat up a can of black beans on the stove with fajita seasoning, whip up a bowl of guac, season some rice, and pile it all into a bowl for maximum enjoyment.</p>\n<p><strong>YUM</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xL6ZZyTvHTSpJMlQKsTrnE-Hi1wZGxznWgD_ObbvWbklroelEJZ_VbrWWy94DcXKg5L0YkmD8QDXcGwO22F5FGrF239GfqSLpVLztVqeBRdZvJD3Jc6MAz34MwIAlofEobmL9DERXd5mnUr8QLuB6BFV-0xhD_a6QGAgQJ4cmT9_43BOz3KM62S4BUUgVmaOJlWKdrhmR2ofdLorNosZgzIDYgTz_HXwvI1gqFOXM3xuNSM6al6BHDzGZ4kaU0FULQK2yqYeVhjmITl18AMrkF7kAWEHQg2tqlKwkjUr-3rHanBHgZkTLGL8VUFW7HFhkDueldqQf2ncPqYnWaNX5QS9SkTsItWwwa3B9KMHkLUy_67Kvj9XZO0UsPqEE2KFPwTc9fRnp5_Q99tD4prLJOEOe163hnXwv_CqGdoUqvZ7XAOllyG5KSDf9l8Eh6xEGk2m2KjFV7PTGe-cLtWs1PQXK_luSKEbHRYRudXOEzt4tXAC9D5p_7NgVdDFabK0nnyeB1ZyF0TxgBJ3aeX95mu5Xuji-19kMRtRm4MIy4SrkPgGzg4-aUDjWa3dKhSTQWPnQg=w1974-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ewDBn95P9kq6uqHSJWTKr6oWxcR3SMcgHkeY-RbMuo1yNwiTJPxKkukIbJF-JWHEFymzYXjq_CAvb8ipFVPramGvtS6YZtFQOAQKXFciCOrzGF9JKRjNKWA5REjGuiNj8OIuNBTDWnmS2ihENrJvss7ISYcsaKA4Ar7GoEgtkqQESGinvSi7zcA6G72cid8hAl-ppVQZ5lIWlJaOkpApzI89lG_XAinfFXNtku5PvS5fRY2ciVY5r6_U9L3DMy5fIRVRKfXNSgUzbU6SHmg8yFtqnsy-DhSMZffu7-boB5gHuY8wbYt5LHVG89pa8eVecezdiLQtAedqFwo3ggBgqDnLZ0OXpVSe0duttQKIKTnAdA9NPelgIqOKwfPwUZHVi6cTxpIdZfwiildi3OuS7Ps13dn8IZJu-m5oIF3XOjvtokCgR3zOaUy0IIVkfo9P0CUrVWyuko20DXOrrcO4MPwhRjjzHYtIrcoopywcZN_fOkbtB-xHLKEjhO7idj_yaLU_EsqrMJihJiz7oduRC7668bpvdW7GfeUuc_IaLHPE5lhchhjBERJ9jdhk2p9OSGku5g=w1386-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>ALSO!
