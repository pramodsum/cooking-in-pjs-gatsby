For example, McDonald's in India actually has\ncompletely vegetarian options. Due to the large  population of vegetarians in\nIndia, McDonald's has 2 segregated kitchens for vegetarian and non-vegetarian\nfood. In addition, they don't serve any beef items, in contrast to the\nMcDonald's in the US, which is primarily beef burgers. Honestly, I love\nMcDonald's in India! They've managed to merge Indian flavors into simple\nAmerican burgers and come out with amazing dishes such as the McSpicy Paneer and\nMcAloo Tiki Burger. If you haven't yet, you should definitely try the McSpicy\nPaneer Burger, it's my favorite! :)\n\n\n\nMy cousin recently had a major craving for Mexican food. The only problem is\nthat we're in India and the Mexican food available doesn't taste quite the same\nnor as authentic. In order to quench our cravings, we even tried going to Taco\nBell, which has a new item called the Paneer Tikka Masala Burrito! Unfortunately\nthe menu had been too Indianized and no longer tasted Mexican. While this style\nof Taco Bell is very popular with people in India, it doesn't quite measure up\nto the Taco Bell we have in the US.\n\n\n\nOur best bet was to figure out how to make it our selves. Unfortunately we did\nrun into a few bumps along the road:\n\n 1. It is a lot harder to find iceberg lettuce in Bangalore than originally\n    suspected. Iceberg lettuce isn't really in any kind of Indian food therefore\n    only available at some special markets rather than on every street vegetable\n    cart.\n\n\n\n 2. Many people tend to substitute dahi for sour cream out of convenience,\n    however, this doesn't have quite the same taste. Conveniently, we found a\n    fairly easy recipe\n    [http://www.tarladalal.com/Sour-Cream-(--Wraps-and-Rolls)-32623r]  on how to\n    make our own homemade sour cream! Tarla Dalal [http://www.tarladalal.com] \n    to the rescue!\n\n\n\n 3. Making the refried beans for the tacos ended up being extremely time\n    consuming. If I had been in the US, I could have just bought a can of beans,\n    cooked them with some cumin and cayene pepper and been done with it. I\n    completely took for granted the preparation needed to make refried beans.\n    First you needed to soak and cook the beans until they were soft, and then\n    cook them in a pan with the appropriate seasoning. This took much longer\n    than I had originally expected.\n\n\n\nWe realized even making tortillas by hand wouldn't be so bad. Every morning, the\ncook at my grandparents house makes chapatis from scratch. Tortillas are\nesentially chapatis made from normal flour, not wheat. So my grandmother quickly\nwhipped up a huge ball of dough for us to roll out and make into tortillas.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo taco would be complete without salsa! We made 2 different types of salsa,\ncorn with jalapenos and pico de gallo salsa. Both salsas are extremely easy to\nmake. For the corn salsa, you just need to combine boiled sweet corn kernels,\ndiced jalapenos, lemon juice, salt, and some cilantro. Mix it together and\nviola! You have salsa. Similarly, if you mix diced tomatoes and onions, minced\ngarlic, cilantro, and lemon juice you get pico de gallo salsa. Both can be made\nvery quickly and are fresh and delicious!\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly everything turned out really tasty and me and my cousin happily\nenjoyed delicious Mexican food for the next 2 days! :) My cousin loved it so\nmuch, she ate it for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner for the next 2 days.
