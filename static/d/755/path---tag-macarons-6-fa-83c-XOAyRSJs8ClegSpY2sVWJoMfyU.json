And\nI figured if I made them all blue and yellow then all the better... GO BLUE! I\nlooked at the recipe, saw the ingredients and was confident that this dessert\nwas within my range of baking abilities. In fact, I was SO confident that I\ncalled a friend of mine to come over and reap the benefits of my baking!\n\nClearly such confidence could only yield brilliant results.\n\nWRONG\n\nMaking macarons is a very delicate process that requires a lot more patience and\nskill than I had ever anticipated! And for that very reason, the adorable\nmacarons I had been picturing in my head came out like this.\n\n\n\nExactly like you picture macarons in French Patisseries right?! I know... I was\njust as disappointed as you. It basically became some strange almond flavored\nfruit roll ups. Not at all appetizing. Now there was another problem... I had a \nTON  of almond batter that clearly wasn't going to make macarons and no idea\nwhat to do with it. My cousin saved my ass and suggested I just convert them\ninto almond cupcakes.\n\nHonestly, I think it was my disappointment at failing to make macrons but I half\nheartedly made these cupcakes. So much so that I didn't even bother with my\nusual photo shoot of the final masterpiece. I have absolutely no photos of what\nthey turned out to look like. Nada. Zilch. But imagine they looked something\nlike this except light yellow and blue with little almond specs all inside.\n\n\n\nThey weren't especially sweet cupcakes so I figured they needed some kind of\ntopping to balance out the flavors. I went back and made some of my handy\ncaramel bourbon sauce, which is just melted caramel, a little water, and some \nCaramel Southern Comfort [http://www.southerncomfort.com/age?ref=caramel]. First\noff, it's heavenly and just a little boozy. Secondly, it basically takes you 2\nminutes to make.\n\nFinally having somewhat salvaged this disaster, I took the box of what I thought\nwas my failures to work. After keeping it out in the lounge area, I quickly\nlearned that the combination of almond cupcakes with caramel bourbon sauce\nworks.... like really  works.\n\nAnyways, here's what I think was the makeshift cupcake recipe. More or less...\n\n\"Macaron\" Almond Cupcakes\nIf the consistency doesn't seem like normal cupcake batter, add more flour. I\nkinda estimated the amounted needed and had to add more to my batter. But that\nmay have only been because I was adapting from a macaron recipe.\n Ingredients:\n2/3 cup ground almonds\n 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar\n 3 large egg whites\n 5 tbsp granulated sugar\n 1 tsp vanilla extract\n 2 tsp baking powder\n 2 cups flour\n 1/2 cup melted butter\n 1 cup milk\n Directions:\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees. Spray the cupcake pan with cooking spray and\nkeep it aside.\n\nMix butter and sugar together and then beat in egg whites. Mix in the flour,\nground almonds, and baking powder. Add in milk and vanilla and beat well. Pour\nbatter into pan and bake for about 15 minutes or until you can poke a cupcake\nwith a knife or toothpick and it comes out clean.","feature_image":"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/82/15/ae/8215ae44e248f2901f8b6205b2c1cdd3.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c253","name":"cupcakes","slug":"cupcakes"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c27f","name":"macarons","slug":"macarons"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c286","name":"almond","slug":"almond"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c287","name":"fail","slug":"fail"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"macarons","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
