You just have to make sure that you soak the hardier legumes (black eyes peas, kidney beans, black beans, etc.) overnight, and the lentils and rice for three or four hours. It's also important to have a good rice to lentil ratio. You want to make sure that approximately one third of the total quantity is rice, so if you have two cups combined of lentils and legumes, you would want one cup of rice in there.\n      These dosas can be eaten with yogurt, any chutney or pickle you like, or, if you're so inclined, plain. They would also be wonderful with sauteed vegetables. </em></p>\n      <p>Yield: Approximately 10 10-inch dosas, 3 - 4 servings</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"time\">\n      <p><strong>Total Time:</strong> <span class=\"duration\">1 hour active, 12 hours passive</span></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup black beans</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup chana dal</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup toor dal</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup split peas</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup brown rice</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/2 tbls fresh ginger</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 tbls whole black pepper</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 tbls cumin</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup coconut (dry and fresh both fine)</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 bunch cilantro</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">fresh green chili, to taste</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">salt, to taste</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>\n1.) Soak the black beans the night before, and start soaking the lentils about six hours before you want to eat them. \n</p><p>\n2.) Combine all ingredients including spices in the food processor with the water you soaked them in, and let it run. The resulting mixture shouldn't be too runny or too thick, and will be a little grainy, but not chunky. While it won't be as smooth as pancake batter, the lentils should be broken down quite well. \n</p><p>\n3.) Once your batter is ready, turn on your stove and let a skillet heat with a small amount of oil. You want the skillet to be hot and the oil covering the surface - if you put your batter on the skillet too soon it will stick! Put a small amount of batter in the center of your skillet, and careful spread it out with a spiraling motion until it's the desired size. Pour a small amount of oil (1/4 teaspoon) on the surface of the dosa, and then cover the pan. \n</p><p>\n4.) Let it cook for three - four minutes, before removing the cover, and flipping the dosa so the other side can cook.\n</p><p>\n5.) Cooking time varies based on the stove and the pan you're using, so give yourself a bit of leeway here. If your first dosa falls apart (as mine did) scrape it off, rinse your skillet, and start fresh - with a bit of trial and error, these become super easy! Once both sides of your dosa are cooked, it's ready!

Put flour and salt in a mixing bowl, and mix together thoroughly. Add the coconut oil and crumble it in with your fingers, until you have a mixture that looks a little sandy - the coconut oil should not disappear completely, but should be in small pea-sized or smaller chunks. Add ice water a tablespoon at a time until you have a dough that's smooth, not too dry, and fairly elastic.\n</p><p> \n2.) Roll out the dough into a rectangle, about 6x11. Fold the two short ends in, so that you have a rectangle one third the size of the original. Then roll it out again to roughly the same size, and fold again from the short ends. Repeat this process seven or eight times - this is what creates the layers in your pastry, and I found that while this method takes time, it was not too strenuous and yielded good results. \n</p><p> \n3.) Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Let chill for a minimum of four hours. This dough can be chilled for several days, so it works really well if you're trying to make it in advance. \n</p><p> \n4.) Now it's time for the filling! Put your cored and grated apples into a saucepan, and turn on the heat. Add sugar and spices, and mix thoroughly. Allow the apples to become soft and fragrant; any juice produced should evaporate, so that you have mixture without extra moisture.\n</p><p>\n5.) Once apples are cooked through, add extracts and cook for one minute. Take off the heat and add lime juice and pecans. Stir completely before setting in fridge to chill. The filling needs to be cold before you make your pastries, so that it doesn't melt the coconut oil prematurely. \n</p><p>\n6.) Grease two cookie trays with coconut oil and chill in the fridge or freezer.\n</p><p> \n7.) Let three - four hours pass. Read a book. Take a long walk, or a short hike. Watch some television, or make animals out of passing clouds. \n</p><p> \n8.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Take your chilled dough out of the fridge and cut into 16 pieces with a sharp knife. Take one piece and roll it into a ball, and set on a floured surface. Roll it out into a circle about 4 - 5 inches in diameter. \n</p><p>\n9.) Place about a tablespoon of filling in the middle of the circle, and dot the circumference with water, to make sure it sticks. Fold the dough on three sides, so that the base forms a triangle. Press the dough together as shown in the pictures below, so that the seams meet in the center. Set it onto your chilled baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. You might have some filling leftover, depending on the size of your apples. \n![alt](https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/a5avl89yja4umc0kd06f96jnrymm9c1s.jpg)\n</p><p>\n10.) Bake for thirty five - forty five minutes. The tops should be golden brown and crispy, and some of the apple juices will escape onto the tray. That's okay. \n</p><p> \n11.) When they're done, take them out, and wait for them to cool. Or, if you're like me, pick one up, bite in, mouth breathe until it cools, and then lament the fact that your burned the roof of your mouth. It's fine. These taste great with a bit of vanilla ice cream (vegan or otherwise), a warm cup of tea, or just on their own as well.  \n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>","title":"Vegan Love Triangles","slug":"love_triangles","published_at":"18 January, 2016","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/praw2vkc61bu1p72w4hn5xgo6d1t6au8.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b4","slug":"warmapplepie-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b5","slug":"allamerican-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b7","slug":"veganpastry-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bc","slug":"pastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bd","slug":"puffpastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","slug":"desserts"}]}}}
