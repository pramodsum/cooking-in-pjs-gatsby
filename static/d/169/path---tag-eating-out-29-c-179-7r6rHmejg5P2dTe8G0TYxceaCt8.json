I know right?! So\nawesome. You can thank me later. AND to make things better... instead of sharing\njust a single song... I'm going to gift you with a whole playlist of my favorite\nsongs from Coachella!\n\nSo very typical of me, I didn't double check my flight timings when booking so I\nended up flying out to LAX a whole 10 hours before the rest of my group. I\ndecided to start the trip out right, eggs Benedict and a mimosa at the airport\nwith a side of Gilmore Girls.\n\n\n\nUsually 10 hours stranded at an airport is a bummer, but there are worse places\nto get stranded than LAX. It kind of ended up working out for me because I took\nmy camera and explored! I walked from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach and\nsoaked in the gorgeous SoCal sun.\n\nIn Santa Monica, I stopped at the Lobster for some AMAZING crab cake. Seriously,\nprobably the best I've ever had in my life.\n\n\n\nIn Venice Beach, I decided to have a lighter option and enjoyed some Burrata and\nBeets at Larry's Bar & Grill.\n\n\n\nThe most adventurous meal was at dinner with a friend at Wurstküche. We enjoyed\nsome cold beers and Rattlesnake Sausages. It honestly didn't taste much\ndifferent from other sausages and was actually pretty good but I can't say I'd\ncomfortably eat that again.\n\n\n\nThe weekend was filled with new musical obsessions, including Zhu & Flume\n(seriously check out that playlist ^), new friends, delicious eats, and lots and\nlots of dust. We danced our asses off to Zedd and Calvin Harris, reveled in the\nunfair flawlessness that is Ellie Goulding, and sang our hearts out with Akon,\nSean Paul, and Nico&Vinz during Matoma's set.\n\n\n\n\n\nI came back home the following Monday sunburned (what happens when you wander\naround LA without sunscreen) and exhausted out of my mind; Cue sickness.\n\nThis was my first year attending Coachella, every instagrammer's and basic\nbitch's haven. Of course I had to have ONE basic picture myself to commemorate\nthe experience.\n\n\n\nCoachella is also a GREAT place for foodies. While you needed to be a VIP to get\naccess to some of the tastiest and more exclusive food, there was plenty of\ndelicious options to spare. Looking back at my food photos, I realize that I\nbasically survived off fries. Just fries. And obviously watermelon, because it\nIS Coachella. But these fries were no ordinary fries my friends. They were all\nloaded with various toppings and delicious goodness.\n\nVeggie Monster Fries with lots of types of slaw and jalapeños!\n\n\nVegetarian Poutin Fries with cheese curds!\n\n\nCrab Fries! This meant crab aioli AND crab topping! Double yum!\n\n\nChicharones Fries with Sriracha and curry aioli!\n\n\nI honestly have no idea how most of these things were made but my stomach was\nhella happy. :)","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/7w01lehlhccieop2u2338p9bk04fle3u.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c321","name":"coachella","slug":"coachella"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c233","name":"fries","slug":"fries"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c246","name":"carnivores","slug":"carnivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c322","name":"poutin","slug":"poutin"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c323","name":"crab","slug":"crab"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c5","name":"vegetarian","slug":"vegetarian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c324","name":"chicharones","slug":"chicharones"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c325","name":"music","slug":"music"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c326","name":"venice beach","slug":"venice-beach"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c327","name":"santa monica","slug":"santa-monica"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c328","name":"LA","slug":"la"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c329","name":"rattlesnake","slug":"rattlesnake"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c32a","name":"burrata","slug":"burrata"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","name":"eating out","slug":"eating-out"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c360","uuid":"bd3e7708-eadc-4969-886c-47fdd2138304","title":"How to do a food crawl","slug":"food-crawl","published_at":"25 April, 2016","plaintext":"I'm sure most of y'all have been on a bar crawl - you have a list of bars, and\nyou hit them up one after the other, sipping a little of this and a little of\nthat at each one.\n\nThis is similar, but with FOOD. While you are certainly welcome bring booze into\nthe mix, these are instructions for figuring out an all food crawl; it's an\nexcellent way to explore a new city!\n\nIt's also a really good way to spend a couple of hours with friends without\nspending a ton of money; if you're on a budget, this is a great way to try lots\nof different food, and see quite a bit, without breaking the bank. We each paid\nfor one entree at one place, and it came out perfectly for us!\n\nFirst, you need a walkable city. I myself did this with my friends Eden and\nHafsa in San Francisco, the day I last left Sumu.\n\n\n\nSecond, do some preliminary research. Don't actually choose all the places you\nwant to go, but choose 1 or 2, or find a neighborhood that has a ton of stuff\nyou're interested in exploring. We found ourselves wandering around the Mission\nDistrict, ogling wall art and talking about gentrification.\n\nThird, set off on your journey! Start with a place you know you want to go to;\nwe started with Philz Coffee, which also let us sip and wander for a bit before\nwe found real food.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the next several hours, we tried Thai food, Mexican food,\nVietnamese food, and, finally, Ethiopian food. At each place, we would choose\none entree to share, so that in the end, we all got to try tons of yummy food\nfor relatively little!\n\nWe were having so much fun we failed to take a lot of pictures, but this is\ndefinitely one of those days that I'll be remembering for quite a while! If you\ndo a food crawl, let me know how it goes!\n\nAnd, if you're in DC or San Francisco and you're interested in doing this, hit\nSumu or I up! We'd love to have you :)","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ifb3j8uif6p154mugitpvrh06kyjpziu.jpeg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c246","name":"carnivores","slug":"carnivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","name":"eating out","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c235","name":"vietnamese","slug":"vietnamese"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c243","name":"mexican","slug":"mexican"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c250","name":"thai","slug":"thai"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f5","name":"san francisco","slug":"san-francisco"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31b","name":"betterlate","slug":"betterlate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31c","name":"than never","slug":"than-never"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31d","name":"monday","slug":"monday"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31e","name":"food crawl","slug":"food-crawl"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31f","name":"ethiopian","slug":"ethiopian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c320","name":"mission","slug":"mission"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c36b","uuid":"8abb8e5a-35f6-448b-a1d9-8decec1d3d4d","title":"Vidhyarthi Bhavan","slug":"vidhyarthi-bhavan","published_at":"01 February, 2016","plaintext":"I'm feeling homesick today. A year ago, I was in India, probably eating chaat\n(Indian street food), or taking pictures of my cousins while they danced around\nwith stuffed animals.\n\n\n\nI miss India a lot. I always loved visiting my family there, and going for eight\nmonths was one of the most valuable times in my life. I loved every minute of\nit.\n\nThis is a post about a breakfast place in Bangalore, Karnataka, India that\neveryone goes to. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEvery city has this restaurant. It's not classically pretty, and there's no one\nwaiting at the door to see whether or not you want to come in. This is a place\nwhere you have to leave your diet at the door (no one has any idea how many\ncalories/protein grams/vats of butter are in your food anyway). The waiters are\ninattentive enough that a newcomer would have left on the spot, and there are\nliterally never enough seats. There are a few places like this in Bangalore (in\na city this big, with this much traffic, you need multiple choice breakfast\nspots), but Vidhyarthi Bhavan is arguably one of the most delicious.\n\nIt's packed to the brim every day; I went on a Monday morning, and we had to\nstand behind people to snake their seats. And after we ate, people were standing\nbehind us to snake ours. The restaurant is famous for it's Masala Dosa, although\nthere are a couple of other items on the menu if you're interested.\n\nWhile you wait for your order, there are gorgeous photos of Mount Kailash, and\nreally interesting pencil sketches of famous poets and writers of India adorning\nthe walls.\n\n\n\nThere's plenty of fodder for people watching, if the smells wafting from the\nkitchen aren't enough to keep you totally occupied. Finally, your order comes\nout.\n\nThe dosas come to you on plates piled high in the waiter's arms (you have a\nbrief moment where you are concerned that the bottom of someone else's plate has\nbeen all over your food); the waiter never actually looks at you before he heads\nto the next table. Then a second waiter, arguably less attentive than the first,\ncomes over with a tureen of coconut, cilantro, and mint chutney and pours it\nonto your plate.\n\nYou dig in with your fingers, barely resisting the urge to just dig in with your\nwhole face. Finishing one of these babies is a task and a half, but you are\ndefinitely up to the challenge; going, going...gone.\n\n\n\nFinally, you get a cup of some excellent filter coffee to finish you right off,\nbefore you stumble into the daylight, and onto a street lined with flower and\nfruit merchants.\n\nYou amble along, sniffing deeply and enjoying the almost-too-full-but-not-quite\nfeeling in your stomach, and all feels right with the world.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/by56r0iw8pjezazv9tvz46spa9zyx530.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c245","name":"india","slug":"india"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ca","name":"masala dosa","slug":"masala-dosa"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","name":"eating out","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cb","name":"indian food","slug":"indian-food"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cc","name":"south indian","slug":"south-indian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cd","name":"bangalore","slug":"bangalore"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ce","name":"vidhyarthi bhavan","slug":"vidhyarthi-bhavan"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cf","name":"nostalgia","slug":"nostalgia"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d0","name":"homesick","slug":"homesick"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c34f","uuid":"7e8c442d-4c8d-4c6b-8667-33acc5c95e1a","title":"The Glorious Monstrosities of Frita Batidos","slug":"frita-batidos","published_at":"27 March, 2015","plaintext":"\n\nFrita Batidos is one of the crown jewels of Ann Arbor, MI. It is a small cuban\nstreet food restaurant in downtown Ann Arbor. While it may be a slight walk from\nthe University of Michigan campus, many students make the trek despite any\nridiculous weather conditions to get a bite of these burgers.\n\nThey have the one of the most delicious, insanely huge and jam packed burgers\nI’ve ever eaten in my life. No matter the patty you want inside your burger,\nwhether it be black bean, chicken, or chorizo, you’re bound to get a tasty\nconcoction which will blow your mind. Honestly I have yet to meet a person at\nthe University of Michigan who doesn’t like their burgers.\n\nThe basic burger (or Frita) is simple, just the patty between two egg buns and\nstuffed with fries. I also added some cilantro-lime salsa and tropical slaw to\njuice it up a little. Safe to say, I don’t think I would be trying to impress\nanyone while eating this monstrosity.\n\n\n\nMy brother always goes with a sunny side up egg and avocado spread on his frita.\nAs soon as you bite into the burger, the yolk bursts, spreading that wonderful\nflavor into every bite thereafter.\n\n\n\nThis trip to Frita Batidos was special because we brought one of my friends here\nfor her first time. She decided to go big or go home and made her frita “loco.”\nThis means that they just go “loco” and add ALL of their available toppings on\ntop of your burger: muenster, a sunny side up egg, cilantro lime salsa, tropical\nslaw, AND avocado spread! This is pretty much the mother of all burgers. I mean\nits GINORMOUS. My friend wasn’t even able to attempt to eat this with her hands.\nBut oh was it delicious.\n\n\n\nDon’t get me started on their garlic-cilantro fries. Frita Batidos has some of\nthe simplest yet most amazing fries I’ve had. I can’t even describe them, you\nhave to try them yourself!\n\n\n\nIf you are ever in Ann Arbor MAKE SURE  you head to downtown to taste one of\nthese monstrosities, these glorious monstrosities of Frita Batidos.\n\nCheck them out [http://www.fritabatidos.com]!","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8669/16240858444_1a3f8e5341_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c233","name":"fries","slug":"fries"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c246","name":"carnivores","slug":"carnivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","name":"eating out","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c263","name":"frita batidos","slug":"frita-batidos"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c264","name":"burgers","slug":"burgers"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c265","name":"cuban","slug":"cuban"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c266","name":"garlic","slug":"garlic"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eating-out","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
