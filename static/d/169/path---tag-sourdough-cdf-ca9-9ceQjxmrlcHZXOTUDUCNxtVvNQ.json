I love the original song by Zella Day but this mix is also amazing. Enjoy!</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:1lhLZGDYPwXeOjfpxMWtQZ\" width=\"auto\" max-width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>Ever since I was a kid, I was always that weird one who LOVED spinach. All my friends would fight and complain but I would ALWAYS ask for more. I know. I was that kid. I was also that kid who would happily drink a glass of plain milk every day. Anyways... I love spinach. Whenever I used to make omelets for my mom, she used to complain that she could never find the egg because I had overloaded it with so much spinach.</p>\n<p>So when I was living alone in Sunnyvale, I decided one week I was going to be super healthy and make meals filled with tons of vegetables. Obviously, this being me, ended up just an obscene amount of spinach and mushrooms. That's about it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/s87a60v38mfk5xbloe2r5i0ftvajj24h.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This recipe is super easy and delicious.
