A year ago, I was in India, probably eating chaat\n(Indian street food), or taking pictures of my cousins while they danced around\nwith stuffed animals.\n\n\n\nI miss India a lot. I always loved visiting my family there, and going for eight\nmonths was one of the most valuable times in my life. I loved every minute of\nit.\n\nThis is a post about a breakfast place in Bangalore, Karnataka, India that\neveryone goes to. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nEvery city has this restaurant. It's not classically pretty, and there's no one\nwaiting at the door to see whether or not you want to come in. This is a place\nwhere you have to leave your diet at the door (no one has any idea how many\ncalories/protein grams/vats of butter are in your food anyway). The waiters are\ninattentive enough that a newcomer would have left on the spot, and there are\nliterally never enough seats. There are a few places like this in Bangalore (in\na city this big, with this much traffic, you need multiple choice breakfast\nspots), but Vidhyarthi Bhavan is arguably one of the most delicious.\n\nIt's packed to the brim every day; I went on a Monday morning, and we had to\nstand behind people to snake their seats. And after we ate, people were standing\nbehind us to snake ours. The restaurant is famous for it's Masala Dosa, although\nthere are a couple of other items on the menu if you're interested.\n\nWhile you wait for your order, there are gorgeous photos of Mount Kailash, and\nreally interesting pencil sketches of famous poets and writers of India adorning\nthe walls.\n\n\n\nThere's plenty of fodder for people watching, if the smells wafting from the\nkitchen aren't enough to keep you totally occupied. Finally, your order comes\nout.\n\nThe dosas come to you on plates piled high in the waiter's arms (you have a\nbrief moment where you are concerned that the bottom of someone else's plate has\nbeen all over your food); the waiter never actually looks at you before he heads\nto the next table. Then a second waiter, arguably less attentive than the first,\ncomes over with a tureen of coconut, cilantro, and mint chutney and pours it\nonto your plate.\n\nYou dig in with your fingers, barely resisting the urge to just dig in with your\nwhole face. Finishing one of these babies is a task and a half, but you are\ndefinitely up to the challenge; going, going...gone.\n\n\n\nFinally, you get a cup of some excellent filter coffee to finish you right off,\nbefore you stumble into the daylight, and onto a street lined with flower and\nfruit merchants.\n\nYou amble along, sniffing deeply and enjoying the almost-too-full-but-not-quite\nfeeling in your stomach, and all feels right with the world.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/by56r0iw8pjezazv9tvz46spa9zyx530.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c245","name":"india","slug":"india"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ca","name":"masala dosa","slug":"masala-dosa"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","name":"eating out","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cb","name":"indian food","slug":"indian-food"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cc","name":"south indian","slug":"south-indian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cd","name":"bangalore","slug":"bangalore"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ce","name":"vidhyarthi bhavan","slug":"vidhyarthi-bhavan"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cf","name":"nostalgia","slug":"nostalgia"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d0","name":"homesick","slug":"homesick"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"indian-food","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
