I love the original song by Zella Day but this mix\nis also amazing. Enjoy!\n\nEver since I was a kid, I was always that weird one who LOVED spinach. All my\nfriends would fight and complain but I would ALWAYS ask for more. I know. I was\nthat kid. I was also that kid who would happily drink a glass of plain milk\nevery day. Anyways... I love spinach. Whenever I used to make omelets for my\nmom, she used to complain that she could never find the egg because I had\noverloaded it with so much spinach.\n\nSo when I was living alone in Sunnyvale, I decided one week I was going to be\nsuper healthy and make meals filled with tons of vegetables. Obviously, this\nbeing me, ended up just an obscene amount of spinach and mushrooms. That's about\nit.\n\n\n\nThis recipe is super easy and delicious. Plus it barely takes any time to make!\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\nSpinach Avocado Crostini\nIngredients:\n1 sourdough baguette\na few handfuls baby spinach leaves\n 2 handfuls mushrooms, sliced\n Component 2\n1/4 red onion, diced\n 1 Avocado, diced in larger chunks\n Balsamic Vinaigrette\n Directions:\nMix the avocado chunks with some balsamic vinaigrette in a bowl and keep to the\nside.\n\nSaut√© the red onions, mushrooms, and spinach in some more balsamic vinaigrette\nor red wine (your choice ;) ) until the spinach has wilted and the mushrooms\nlook like they have been cooked through.\n\nSlice the baguette and top with the avocados and spinach mixtures.
