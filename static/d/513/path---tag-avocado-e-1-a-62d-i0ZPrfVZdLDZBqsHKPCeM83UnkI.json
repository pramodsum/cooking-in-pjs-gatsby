All my friends would fight and complain but I would ALWAYS ask for more. I know. I was that kid. I was also that kid who would happily drink a glass of plain milk every day. Anyways... I love spinach. Whenever I used to make omelets for my mom, she used to complain that she could never find the egg because I had overloaded it with so much spinach.</p>\n<p>So when I was living alone in Sunnyvale, I decided one week I was going to be super healthy and make meals filled with tons of vegetables. Obviously, this being me, ended up just an obscene amount of spinach and mushrooms. That's about it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/s87a60v38mfk5xbloe2r5i0ftvajj24h.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This recipe is super easy and delicious.

The music, the dancing, and let's not forget Diego Luna. In honor of Diego Luna and his amazing dancing, play the song below while you read this post.

However last month when me and my family went to Cancun for a week, I knew I had been missing out on something big. The amazing flavors of corn tortillas, super flavorful meat (or beans for you vegetarians), fresh salsas and Crema Mexicana mesh together for a completely different experience of eating simple tacos. Now that I had officially been converted to a taco snob, I was determined to only eat the best of tacos I could find.</p>\n<p>Conveniently the bay area is filled with the most amazing food, especially when it comes to taco trucks. Each taco truck I've visited usually has a side of a few salsas. I was determined to recreate two of my favorite taco truck salsas, an avocado tomatillo salsa and a spicy red chili salsa, as authentic as possible.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8743/17335026415_ff5458c370_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I found a few recipes online, and experimented on my own and finally ended up with these recipes!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7661/17327373531_b39d8028ec_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Avocado Tomatillo Salsa</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to adjust the number of chilis based on your own spice tolerance.
