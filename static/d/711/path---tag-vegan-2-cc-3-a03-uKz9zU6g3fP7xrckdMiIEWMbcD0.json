The ice cream maker bowl wouldn't\nfreeze, even after 48 hours in the freezer. And then the ice cream itself failed\nto freeze after eight hours in the freezer. It was still delicious, but\ndelicious with the consistency of soft serve, rather than hard ice cream.\n\n\n\nBasically, I made fro yo. With strawberries! Enjoy.\n\n\n\nTitle\nAt some point, ice cream became designated as a summer treat - and I say, down\nwith the discrimination! We should be free to have ice cream all year round!\nDon't let the ice cream fascists take away your fun. \n\nYield: I have no idea. A tupperware container full!\n\nTotal Time:  About one hour of active time, two days of waiting\n\nIngredients:\nIce Cream base\n2 Cans Full Fat Coconut Milk1 Tbls Maple Syrup\n 1 C Cashews\n 1 Tbls Cornstarch or Arrowroot Powder\n Excess Liquid From Jam (see below)\n Jam!\n1 C Strawberries\n 2 C Blueberries1/2 C 100% Fruit Juice (I used a berry blend)1 Tbls Maple Syrup1\nTbls Cornstarch or Arrowroot Powder\n Directions:\n\n1.) First things first, put your ice cream maker's bowl in the freezer, and\nchill your coconut milk in the fridge overnight before you start.\n\n\n2.) Put your strawberries, blueberries, juice, and maple syrup into a saucepan\nand let simmer. When the fruit is about halfway to being complete mush, move to\nstep 3.\n\n\n3.) Crack open your coconut milk and pour into the blender. Add the maple syrup,\nand carefully remove some of the juice that's in your saucepan, and add it as\nwell. This cuts down on simmering time for the jam, and adds color and flavor to\nthe ice cream! Blend.\n\n  \n4.) While the fruit continues to cook, take about 3/4 of the coconut milk you've\nblended up and put it in a container. Then add the arrowroot or cornstarch, and\nblend the remaining 1/4 until fully combined. Pour into container with the rest\nof the coconut milk base.\n\n  \n5.) Your fruit should be complete mush now - if there's any juice left, now is\nthe time to slowly pour it into the ice cream base, until there's only a couple\nof tablespoons of liquid in the saucepan with the fruit.\n\n\n6.) Carefully sprinkle the arrowroot or cornstarch onto the fruit, stirring\nvigorously to prevent clumping. Allow to cook an additional couple of minutes,\nuntil the mixture has thickened just a bit. Remove from heat, and pour into a\ncontainer.\n\n\n7.) Put the coconut milk base and jam into the fridge - both need to chill for a\nbit, at least twelve hours, ideally 24 or more.\n\n\n8.) Climb a tree, read a book, explore nature. Go to work? You do you, boo boo.\n\n\n9.) When all ingredients are thoroughly chilled, follow the directions on your\nice cream maker! When there are five - ten minutes left, add the jam, and allow\nto incorporate completely.\n\n\n10.) Eat ice cream in February. Don't let THE MAN tell you what to do.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/gcws27i9ca8jn5gkqd2j6osakirvt43d.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2df","name":"ice cream","slug":"ice-cream"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","name":"vegan","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","name":"sugarrush","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e0","name":"coconut milk","slug":"coconut-milk"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e1","name":"berries","slug":"berries"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e2","name":"summertime","slug":"summertime"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e3","name":"sweet treats","slug":"sweet-treats"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e4","name":"fight the power","slug":"fight-the-power"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e5","name":"i stand with planned parenthood","slug":"i-stand-with-planned-parenthood"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e6","name":"and black lives matter","slug":"and-black-lives-matter"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e7","name":"and native nations","slug":"and-native-nations"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e8","name":"power to the people","slug":"power-to-the-people"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c35a","uuid":"015353ea-56fa-417c-983c-c5350fb3c81a","title":"Sweet Potato Pie","slug":"sweet-potato-pie","published_at":"25 January, 2016","plaintext":"I made some sweet potato pie today.\n\n\n\nThis was my second time making this dessert, and I made it in a more or less\nsimilar way.\n\nThe first time I made it, I bragged to my housemate, and he asked me if my\nmaking a sweet potato pie was cultural appropriation, and I had no idea, because\nI had no idea sweet potato pie was a thing that black people did. To be honest,\nI thought it was an all-American thing (immigrant probs, amirite?) So I\nresearched - and I found out that historically, sweet potato pie was a food\nslaves made in the south. And I had no idea until I made it and someone else\ncalled me out on it!\n\n\n\nHere's the thing about cultural appropriation in food - it happens ALL THE TIME.\nPeople love to take foods from other cultures - frequently every day,\ncommonplace foods - and remake them with slight tweaks and giant price tags. So\nhow do you avoid it? I personally advocate for research.\n\nI think it's important to know where the food you're making comes from,\nespecially when you're modifying it. I tend to modify a lot of recipes to make\nthem vegetarian or vegan, but I try to do it in a way that feels as respectful\nto me as possible.\n\nI think there's space in food for innovation, but it has to be accompanied by\nrespect for the important place that food has in culture.\n\nSo, the moral of this story? Don't appropriate. Don't glorify the food of\nanother culture without trying to understand that culture itself. Accept that\nyou'll probably be clueless even with additional information, and do your best\nto be respectful.\n\nAnd also, have some pie.\n\n\n\nSweet Potato Pie\nThis is a filling dessert. You could tell yourself it's healthy because it has a\nvegetable as a filling, but let's be real - this is not a healthy dessert. And\nthat's a good thing - sometimes dessert just needs to be decadent.\n\nYield: 1 Pie\n\nTotal Time:  2 hours active cooking time\n\nIngredients:\nPie Crust\n3 C Flour\n 1 Tsp Salt3/4 C Coconut OilIce water, as needed\n Sweet Potato Filling\nThree Medium Sweet Potatoes\n 1 C Coconut Milk Liquid or 1/2 C Almond ButterMaple Syrup, to taste1 1/2 Tsp\nCinnamon1/2 Tsp Cardamom1/2 Tsp Pumpkin Pie Spice1 Tsp Vanilla Extract1 Tsp\nOrange Extract\n Directions:\n\n1.) The pie crust recipe is the same dough as that of my [Love\nTriangles](http://cookinginpjs.com/love_triangles/) from last week. The first\ntime I did it, I added a little bit too much ice water - perhaps a couple\ntablespoons too much - and I wound up with a loose dough I didn't want to add\nmore flour to. So that time, I rolled it out hastily, trying not to handle it\ntoo much to avoid the coconut oil melting prior to baking. This time I managed\nto avoid that pitfall, and carefully added only as much water as was necessary,\nresulting in a soft, elastic, and close-to-perfect dough. I recommend prepping\nand chilling that before you do anything else.\n\n\n2.) I went the simple route; I chopped the sweet potato small, into pieces about\na half inch wide. After you do that, douse them in spices and throw them in the\noven until they are melt-in-your-mouth cooked. Or, you know, about thirty\nminutes.\n\n\n3.) Mashed them, add maple syrup, the some almond butter, or the liquid from a\ncan of coconut milk for creaminess, and your spices and extracts. You want to\nmake sure it isn't too sweet, tasting every time you add a new ingredient to -\nahem - \"assess quality.\" Make sure that the pie isn't so sweet that you can't\ntaste the sweet potato. The goal is to enhance it so it can be the star, not\nmask it.\n\n\n4.) Preheat the oven to 375 F. Take out your pie dough which has, of course,\nchilled for at least four hours at this point, and roll it out gently. Set it\ninto a pie pan/tin, and crimp the edges however you're like. Reserve the cut off\nbits to create a decoration for your pie. Pop the crust in the oven for about\nfifteen minutes.\n\n\n5.) After the pie crust has baked for about fifteen, take the pie out of the\noven and layer in your filling. You want it to be up until the rim of the pie\npan - this filling won't expand, so you can fill it right up. Put the pie back\nin the oven for about twenty minutes.\n\n\n6.) In the meantime, roll out your spare dough and get creative! I went the way\nof stars and diamonds because those are the cookie cutters I found, but the\nworld is your oyster. When twenty minutes have passed, take your pie out of the\noven and carefully place the decorations on top. Put it back in for another 20\nminutes. Proceed to turn on the oven light and watch excitedly, as I did (I\nthink I mistook it for a television).\n\n\n7.) After another twenty minutes have passed, increase the oven temperature to\n400 F, and place your pies on the top rack - I like my top crust to be a little\nbrown, and this makes that happen!\n\n\n8.) Take your pie out of the oven and serve it up! I loved it with a dollop of\ncoconut whipped cream, but it would likely also taste good with ice cream, or\nnormal whipped cream, or any manner of things. It was also excellent all on its\nown.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/1me34o8e4hrj5zs0hqullpkoduharuvp.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","name":"sugarrush","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c3","name":"sweetpotato","slug":"sweetpotato"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c24b","name":"pumpkin pie","slug":"pumpkin-pie"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bc","name":"pastry","slug":"pastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c4","name":"piecrust","slug":"piecrust"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","name":"vegan","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c5","name":"vegetarian","slug":"vegetarian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c382","uuid":"3ef7f523-4fb4-48a5-9fef-b4252d38d598","title":"Vegan Love Triangles","slug":"love_triangles","published_at":"18 January, 2016","plaintext":"When I was making these pastries and trying to find a name for them, I kept\ndrawing a blank. They weren't tarts, they weren't REALLY puff pastry either, and\nI couldn't figure out what to call them. And then, as I was talking to a friend\nabout it, we got into a conversation about euphemisms, and the ones we both\nfavor. Hot box got thrown around a bit, but then we hit on the perfect name.\nVisually accurate (the pastries are triangles) and a little silly.\n\n\n\nLove Triangles.\n\nAnd look, I know it says vegan up there at the top, and I can hear what you're\nthinking: you don't usually like vegan pastry! It's dry, or it's weird, and are\nthere lentils in there because you heard that vegans put lentils in everything!\n\n\n\nBut these pastries don't taste vegan. I think there's this idea that vegan food\nhas to be healthy, and taste healthy, and while I would definitely advocate for\nhealthy food generally, that's not the case here. This recipe is full of lovely\nfats in the form of coconut oil, and yummy yummy carbs. It's delicious. You\nwon't believe it's not butter in there. The pastry is flaky and crisp at the\nsame time, the apples are tender and perfectly cooked, and the pecans add a hint\nof interest inside.\n\n\n\nIt's a teeny weeny pie to warm the bits of your soul that have been snowed into.\nIn the middle of winter, when you come in from the cold, these are the perfect\nbits to warm your hands and your stomach as you cuddle into your couch with a\nwarm cup of tea.\n\nLove Triangles\nThese take a bit of time, but the end result is well worth it. Just note that\nthe chilling instructions aren't really optional; the whole point is to keep the\ncoconut oil intact throughout the preparation, so that when it gets into the\noven, it melts into the pastry creating flakiness and richness. Without chilling\nitems appropriately, the dough becomes too difficult to work with, and it\ndoesn't cook properly in the oven. So. Chill out. Chill your dough, chill your\nbaking trays, chill your filling. Your stomach will thank you later.\n\nYield: 16 mini pastries\n\nTotal Time:  1 hour active, four hours passive\n\nIngredients:\nPastry Dough\n2 C Unbleached All Purpose Flour1 teaspoon salt3/4 C Coconut Oil, cold but\npliableIce Water, 1/4 cup - 1 cup, as needed\n Filling\n4 Medium Apples, preferably a variety, cored and grated\n 1/2 Tsp. Cinnamon1/2 Tsp. All-Spice1/2 Tsp. Nutmeg1/2 Tsp. Cardamom1/2 Tsp.\nBlack Pepper1/2 Tsp. Ginger1/2 Tsp. Orange Extract1 Tsp. Vanilla Extract2 Tsp.\nLime Juice1 C Chopped Pecans\n Directions:\n\n1.) Put flour and salt in a mixing bowl, and mix together thoroughly. Add the\ncoconut oil and crumble it in with your fingers, until you have a mixture that\nlooks a little sandy - the coconut oil should not disappear completely, but\nshould be in small pea-sized or smaller chunks. Add ice water a tablespoon at a\ntime until you have a dough that's smooth, not too dry, and fairly elastic.\n\n  \n2.) Roll out the dough into a rectangle, about 6x11. Fold the two short ends in,\nso that you have a rectangle one third the size of the original. Then roll it\nout again to roughly the same size, and fold again from the short ends. Repeat\nthis process seven or eight times - this is what creates the layers in your\npastry, and I found that while this method takes time, it was not too strenuous\nand yielded good results.\n\n  \n3.) Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Let chill for a minimum of\nfour hours. This dough can be chilled for several days, so it works really well\nif you're trying to make it in advance.\n\n  \n4.) Now it's time for the filling! Put your cored and grated apples into a\nsaucepan, and turn on the heat. Add sugar and spices, and mix thoroughly. Allow\nthe apples to become soft and fragrant; any juice produced should evaporate, so\nthat you have mixture without extra moisture.\n\n\n5.) Once apples are cooked through, add extracts and cook for one minute. Take\noff the heat and add lime juice and pecans. Stir completely before setting in\nfridge to chill. The filling needs to be cold before you make your pastries, so\nthat it doesn't melt the coconut oil prematurely.\n\n\n6.) Grease two cookie trays with coconut oil and chill in the fridge or\nfreezer.\n\n  \n7.) Let three - four hours pass. Read a book. Take a long walk, or a short hike.\nWatch some television, or make animals out of passing clouds.\n\n  \n8.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Take your chilled dough out of the fridge\nand cut into 16 pieces with a sharp knife. Take one piece and roll it into a\nball, and set on a floured surface. Roll it out into a circle about 4 - 5 inches\nin diameter.\n\n\n9.) Place about a tablespoon of filling in the middle of the circle, and dot the\ncircumference with water, to make sure it sticks. Fold the dough on three sides,\nso that the base forms a triangle. Press the dough together as shown in the\npictures below, so that the seams meet in the center. Set it onto your chilled\nbaking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. You might have some\nfilling leftover, depending on the size of your apples. \n![alt](https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/a5avl89yja4umc0kd06f96jnrymm9c1s.jpg)\n\n\n10.) Bake for thirty five - forty five minutes. The tops should be golden brown\nand crispy, and some of the apple juices will escape onto the tray. That's okay.\n\n  \n11.) When they're done, take them out, and wait for them to cool. Or, if you're\nlike me, pick one up, bite in, mouth breathe until it cools, and then lament the\nfact that your burned the roof of your mouth. It's fine. These taste great with\na bit of vanilla ice cream (vegan or otherwise), a warm cup of tea, or just on\ntheir own as well.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/praw2vkc61bu1p72w4hn5xgo6d1t6au8.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b4","name":"warmapplepie","slug":"warmapplepie-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b5","name":"allamerican","slug":"allamerican-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","name":"vegan","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b7","name":"veganpastry","slug":"veganpastry-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bc","name":"pastry","slug":"pastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bd","name":"puffpastry","slug":"puffpastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","name":"sugarrush","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"vegan-2","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
