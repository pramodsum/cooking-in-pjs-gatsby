So, I'm starting a new feature! The &quot;Quick Recipe Fix&quot; - your dose of some of my favorite recipes that I've found on the interwebs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/e1ww9g1kidb63ndvuqe4zzlsqv8mjane.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Enjoy the recipes, and cut me some slack, internet. I've been busy :)</p>\n<p>1.) Love and Lemons is one of my favorite food blogs; they have gorgeous pictures, and I love their fresh approach to food. They have a cookbook out right now that everyone should totally get. I'm also waiting for the day when I can try this recipe for <a href=\"http://www.loveandlemons.com/chickpea-flour-pizza-asparagus/?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds\">Chickpea Flour Pizza Crust</a> because YUM.</p>\n<p>2.) Minimalist Baker hits it out of the park every time. They have a real talent for finding fresh, simple recipes with easy (and short!) cleanup! Check out their recipe for <a href=\"http://minimalistbaker.com/gingery-thai-kale-salad-cashew-dressing/\">Gingery Thai Kale Salad with Cashew Dressing</a></p>\n<p>3.) I love Annie's Eats, especially her cocktail posts! Now that summer's coming, it's time to turn out minds to summertime cocktails, and there's something about this <a href=\"http://www.annies-eats.com/2016/03/25/gin-grapefruit-and-rosemary-cocktail/\">Gin, Grapefruit, and Rosemary Cocktail</a> that feels delightfully spring-y.</p>\n<p>4.) Smitten Kitten is incredibly prolific; they do an amazing job of posting super frequently with high quality recipes! Here's one of there's that I'm pretty sure is an Italian sort of Shakshouka <a href=\"http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2016/03/eggs-in-purgatory-puttanesca-style/\">Eggs in Purgatory, Puttanesca-Style</a>.</p>\n<p>5.) The Beeroness is one of my favorite people on the internet. All of her recipes are accompanied by great stories about her life, and the food itself is nothing to sneeze at. If you're a beer lover OR a food lover, you'll love her blog; right now, I really want to try her <a href=\"http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2016/03/eggs-in-purgatory-puttanesca-style/\">Grilled Garlic-Beer Flatbread</a>.</p>\n<p>Enjoy the recipes, and if you get a chance to try them before I do (super likely) let me know how it goes!</p>\n","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/75ycreg8gpwyyvfdmpmdtiomxiop1sg4.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c26b","name":"food truck","slug":"food-truck"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c242","name":"giggle juice","slug":"giggle-juice"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c314","name":"loving lately","slug":"loving-lately"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c315","name":"favorite blogs","slug":"favorite-blogs"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c316","name":"yum","slug":"yum"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"loving-lately","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
