I have been rushing to get my week's work done by yesterday so that I can be ready to fully enjoy Coachella this year! I am currently on my way there and unbelievably excited! I will report back next week with all the food and excitement!</p>\n<p>I had made these Cinnamon buns a while back when I used to make treats for my coworkers (unfortunately it's been some time since I've done that). I didn't really experiment too much, more or less made the recipe verbatim. I found this recipe for simple and quick <a href=\"http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/whole-wheat-30-minute-mini-cinnamon-buns-and-they-are-healthy/\">whole wheat mini cinnamon buns</a>.</p>\n<p>My chief complaint with this recipe is the fact that whole wheat gives it a whole different and drier texture. Personally if I were to remake these, I'd just use normal flour and make smaller size cinnamon buns. They're tiny anyways so we can splurge on the flour ;)</p>\n<p>Let me know what you think!!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/wd6yuffsgpi30wby34ow9ew6hmzb2wom.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/qulje72c2gd7qydbwogjmo9hzt0j9syj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/atopoadpbxnaqr76f2hxjft79n4c8wxe.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fze2l6asol2ik625i8v08jdbd4gj35lj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29b","name":"cinnamon","slug":"cinnamon"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c30f","name":"fresh rolls","slug":"fresh-rolls"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"teeny-weenie-itsy-bitsy-cinni-minis","previous":{"html":"<p>My brain feels scrambled.

Mix your marinade ingredients together, and add water if you need to so that it's not too thick. It should be roughly the consistency of gravy. \n</p><p> \n2.) Rip your tofu into bit sized chunks with forks or with your hands, and  mix the marinade into the tofu. Set the mixture in the fridge overnight. \n</p><p> \n3.) Chop your broccoli, kale, and mushrooms, and cook your veg - broccoli, then kale and mushrooms together. Be sure to add some salt and spices to the vegetables!\n</p><p> \n4.) When the vegetables are half cooked, create a space, and pour your tofu scramble in. Let it cook for a few minutes, 5-7 should be just enough. \n</p><p> \n5.)

While you are certainly welcome bring booze into the mix, these are instructions for figuring out an all food crawl; it's an excellent way to explore a new city!</p>\n<p>It's also a really good way to spend a couple of hours with friends without spending a ton of money; if you're on a budget, this is a great way to try lots of different food, and see quite a bit, without breaking the bank. We each paid for one entree at one place, and it came out perfectly for us!</p>\n<p>First, you need a walkable city. I myself did this with my friends Eden and Hafsa in San Francisco, the day I last left Sumu.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/nswhwh2moi2lyt9ett886237vfike5xh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Second, do some preliminary research. Don't actually choose all the places you want to go, but choose 1 or 2, or find a neighborhood that has a ton of stuff you're interested in exploring. We found ourselves wandering around the Mission District, ogling wall art and talking about gentrification.</p>\n<p>Third, set off on your journey! Start with a place you know you want to go to; we started with Philz Coffee, which also let us sip and wander for a bit before we found real food.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ifb3j8uif6p154mugitpvrh06kyjpziu.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Over the course of the next several hours, we tried Thai food, Mexican food, Vietnamese food, and, finally, Ethiopian food. At each place, we would choose one entree to share, so that in the end, we all got to try tons of yummy food for relatively little!</p>\n<p>We were having so much fun we failed to take a lot of pictures, but this is definitely one of those days that I'll be remembering for quite a while! If you do a food crawl, let me know how it goes!</p>\n<p>And, if you're in DC or San Francisco and you're interested in doing this, hit Sumu or I up!
