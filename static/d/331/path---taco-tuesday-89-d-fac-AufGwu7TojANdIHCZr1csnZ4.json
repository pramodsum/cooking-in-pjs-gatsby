For example, McDonald's in India actually has completely vegetarian options. Due to the <strong>large</strong> population of vegetarians in India, McDonald's has 2 segregated kitchens for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. In addition, they don't serve any beef items, in contrast to the McDonald's in the US, which is primarily beef burgers. Honestly, I love McDonald's in India! They've managed to merge Indian flavors into simple American burgers and come out with amazing dishes such as the McSpicy Paneer and McAloo Tiki Burger. If you haven't yet, you should definitely try the McSpicy Paneer Burger, it's my favorite! :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7447/16213447308_f042572573_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>My cousin recently had a major craving for Mexican food. The only problem is that we're in India and the Mexican food available doesn't taste quite the same nor as authentic. In order to quench our cravings, we even tried going to Taco Bell, which has a new item called the Paneer Tikka Masala Burrito! Unfortunately the menu had been too Indianized and no longer tasted Mexican. While this style of Taco Bell is very popular with people in India, it doesn't quite measure up to the Taco Bell we have in the US.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-9/p240x240/10500572_10153058890499813_8118498097049613786_n.jpg?oh=045ce9ccadee439cd72f5918fcb7bb3e&amp;oe=55583775&amp;__gda__=1431596238_63eebcd5fe7f4c135a000227d439d70b\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Our best bet was to figure out how to make it our selves. Unfortunately we did run into a few bumps along the road:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is a lot harder to find iceberg lettuce in Bangalore than originally suspected. Iceberg lettuce isn't really in any kind of Indian food therefore only available at some special markets rather than on every street vegetable cart.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7448/16375097256_ab5794a54c_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Many people tend to substitute dahi for sour cream out of convenience, however, this doesn't have quite the same taste. Conveniently, we found a fairly easy <a href=\"http://www.tarladalal.com/Sour-Cream-(--Wraps-and-Rolls)-32623r\">recipe</a> on how to make our own homemade sour cream! <a href=\"http://www.tarladalal.com\">Tarla Dalal</a> to the rescue!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8601/16400164382_73d99cfb83_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Making the refried beans for the tacos ended up being extremely time consuming. If I had been in the US, I could have just bought a can of beans, cooked them with some cumin and cayene pepper and been done with it. I completely took for granted the preparation needed to make refried beans. First you needed to soak and cook the beans until they were soft, and then cook them in a pan with the appropriate seasoning. This took much longer than I had originally expected.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7400/15778603364_95408ed417_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We realized even making tortillas by hand wouldn't be so bad. Every morning, the cook at my grandparents house makes chapatis from scratch. Tortillas are esentially chapatis made from normal flour, not wheat. So my grandmother quickly whipped up a huge ball of dough for us to roll out and make into tortillas.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8588/16213679700_5c8738a6f2_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8606/16375090146_29515989da_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/16214852339_c9de429d99_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>No taco would be complete without salsa! We made 2 different types of salsa, corn with jalapenos and pico de gallo salsa. Both salsas are extremely easy to make. For the corn salsa, you just need to combine boiled sweet corn kernels, diced jalapenos, lemon juice, salt, and some cilantro. Mix it together and viola! You have salsa. Similarly, if you mix diced tomatoes and onions, minced garlic, cilantro, and lemon juice you get pico de gallo salsa. Both can be made very quickly and are fresh and delicious!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7299/16375094646_260f9aa406_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\n<img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7444/15781043603_80df9ccbbd_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Surprisingly everything turned out really tasty and me and my cousin happily enjoyed delicious Mexican food for the next 2 days! :) My cousin loved it so much, she ate it for breakfast, lunch, AND dinner for the next 2 days.

Once I tasted it, I knew that I had been missing out on something delicious my entire life. Pho is a simple vietnamese noodle soup. Traditionally, it is made with beef or chicken with some meat broth, which gives it its rich flavor. However we found a vegetarian way of mimicking the flavor! There's a great recipe <a href=\"http://ohmyveggies.com/30-minute-vegetarian-pho/\">here</a> that also had some great flavors.</p>\n<p>Pho works best if you have fresh bean sprouts, jalapenos, and basil. When you drop these into your soup, it brings out the most amazing flavors. I also chopped some onions, cilantro and some green onions for a little something extra.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7549/15215550764_63933ed924_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The first step in the process is preparing the stock. My mom and I made a vegetable stock using celery, carrots, and onions among other things. All you need to do is simmer vegetables and herbs in a pot and after 30-40 minutes it should be done! You can also use store bought stock, as that is likely far less labor intensive! If you don't mind chicken or beef broth, feel free to use one of those instead and add some cooked shredded chicken or beef too.</p>\n<p>Next, you want to prepare your noodles - you can buy premade rice noodles, or get dry noodles and cook them yourself. But be careful; if they come pre-cooked and packaged they may be extremely fragile and broken. This is what happened to me, as you can see from my pictures. Ideally, the noodles shouldn't break the minute you pick them up with your chopsticks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7513/15650093948_27967e5c09_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now all that's left for you to do is to pour yourself a bowl of hot broth, toss some noodles, vegetables and garnishes and top it off with some sauces. Personally, I just use a little hoisin sauce and chili garlic sauce but feel free to add soy sauce, sriracha, basically anything you want! The best part about Pho is that it can be easily modified to suit each individual's taste!</p>\n<p>If you haven't already, drop everything you're doing, go to the nearest Vietnamese restaurant and dive into a HUGE bowl of Pho!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5615/15837085352_70e3c9fa9c_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7551/15811883866_29a5cdf02b_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"It's about \"Pho\"-king time!","slug":"its-about-pho-king-time","published_at":"31 January, 2015","feature_image":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5615/15837085352_70e3c9fa9c_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c235","slug":"vietnamese"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c236","slug":"pho"}]},"next":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2947/15238764929_dee408af1f_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>When I was younger, my family rarely did breakfast all together; on weekdays we were all rushing around, and on weekends we would all emerge from our rooms at our own times, grazing on whatever acceptable breakfast food was around. For many years, breakfast on Saturday meant spending the entire morning alone on the couch, watching cartoons, dodging my mother's attempts to make me a productive citizen, and eating sugary cereal with abandon. Occasionally, we would have guests and my mother would cook some traditional Indian breakfast items - dosa, roti, upma, etc. - and we would have brunch. But these days were usually paired with pre and post cleaning and formal clothing, so while we loved the company, the whole situation was no bueno.</p>\n<p>It wasn't until I got to college that I really understood brunch. On our campus, Landon dining hall had the most amazing brunch you can imagine - everything from ice cream to omelettes to fresh fruit and berries was represented, and you could literally eat your heart out. In addition to that, we lived in close proximity to Golden Harvest, a small brunch area in Lansing that has a following that borders on obsessive. In East Lansing, brunch does not just pass you by, and from the minute I stepped into Landon, with a slight headache and stomache, craving grease and comfort food, I was a convert.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8656/16296194440_27d1c24829_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Brunch is neither breakfast nor lunch; it's an in between meal, and as such, doesn't have the conventions of the other two. You can enjoy some giggle juice with brunch. You can dip strawberries in chocolate and throw it on a waffle with sugar and it won't count as dessert. You can show up all smelly at your best friend's house at eleven o'clock, post late wake up call and workout, demand eggs, toast, and avocados, and call THAT brunch.</p>\n<p>You can wake up at eight AM and race to Golden Harvest, wait in line for over an hour and a half in the freezing cold, and earn your brunch. Or you can have a lie in at home and make yourself some waffles or toast and watch television, and it could be the most lovely brunch you'll ever have.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7560/15811864496_20a9e2f76e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Brunch is the most welcoming of the meals.</p>\n<p>Brunch is patient, brunch is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Brunch does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Brunch never fails.*</p>\n<p>Brunch is love, y'all. Show someone a little love and pan fry some potatoes and throw a poached egg on top. Give yourself a little treat and stick an overeasy fried egg in a sandwhich with some mixed greens and tomatoes. Use avocado liberally, and consider experimenting with sriracha and truffle oil. Kale and white sugar are both invited to this party, because brunch does not discriminate.</p>\n<p>Let your creative juices and chocolate sauce flow; brunch is a meal without protocol or limitations, and you definitely deserve that business in your life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5612/15837068312_eeff7d20e1_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>*I took some creative licenses with Corinthians 13:4-8a.
