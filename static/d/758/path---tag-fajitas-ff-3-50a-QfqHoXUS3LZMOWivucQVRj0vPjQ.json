Despite his many divorces and nerdy dinosaur quirks, Dr.\nGellar (no not that kind of doctor) was one of my favorite characters on\nFriends. Every time I make fajitas I remember Ross absolutely \"NOT\" being weird\nabout Joey and Rachel starting to go out. One of the most classic Ross moments\non the show.\n\n\n\nI was in India when Netflix released all ten seasons of Friends.\n\nALL. TEN. SEASONS. EASILY. ACCESSIBLE. ON. THE. INTERNET.\n\nThis was huge. I can't even begin to count the endless number of illegally\nuploaded episodes I've watched on YouTube with Spanish subtitles. I ended up\nlearning various inappropriate words through context. Made for some fun giggles\nduring Spanish class.\n\nWhile I was searching a mood song for this post, I stumbled onto this gem. It's\nso weird that it HAD to make it into the post.\n\nBack to the point. So this January when I was in India, my cousin had major\ncravings for Mexican food. We decided to enhance our existing Galentine's Day\nplans from just red velvet cupcakes\n[http://cookinginpjs.com/galentines-day-cupcakes/]  to include some simple yet\ndelicious Mexican food.\n\nA lot of the parts of this recipe have already been posted in other posts, so\nI'm just going to link those rather than retyping. I just saut√©d a some spinach,\nbell peppers, onions, and mushrooms with my own fajita seasoning\n[http://cookinginpjs.com/estoy-cantando/]  recipe. Added some corn salsa and \nhomemade sour cream [http://cookinginpjs.com/taco-tuesday/]  and flour tortillas\n[http://cookinginpjs.com/taco-tuesday/]. All you have left to do is roll it up\nand enjoy!\n\nRecipes:\n\n * fajita seasoning [http://cookinginpjs.com/estoy-cantando/]\n * homemade sour cream & flour tortillas [http://cookinginpjs.com/taco-tuesday/]","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/3chnt4gzvs3sg5exnvkiiy2q53zgqxfd.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c243","name":"mexican","slug":"mexican"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c245","name":"india","slug":"india"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c252","name":"fajitas","slug":"fajitas"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29c","name":"friends","slug":"friends"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29d","name":"ross","slug":"ross"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2aa","name":"family","slug":"family"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fajitas","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
