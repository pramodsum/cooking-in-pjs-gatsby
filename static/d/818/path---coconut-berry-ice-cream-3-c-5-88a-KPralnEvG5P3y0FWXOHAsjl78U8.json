First things first, put your ice cream maker's bowl in the freezer, and chill your coconut milk in the fridge overnight before you start. \n</p><p>\n2.) Put your strawberries, blueberries, juice, and maple syrup into a saucepan and let simmer. When the fruit is about halfway to being complete mush, move to step 3. \n</p><p>\n3.) Crack open your coconut milk and pour into the blender. Add the maple syrup, and carefully remove some of the juice that's in your saucepan, and add it as well. This cuts down on simmering time for the jam, and adds color and flavor to the ice cream! Blend. \n</p><p> \n4.) While the fruit continues to cook, take about 3/4 of the coconut milk you've blended up and put it in a container. Then add the arrowroot or cornstarch, and blend the remaining 1/4 until fully combined. Pour into container with the rest of the coconut milk base. \n</p><p> \n5.) Your fruit should be complete mush now - if there's any juice left, now is the time to slowly pour it into the ice cream base, until there's only a couple of tablespoons of liquid in the saucepan with the fruit. \n</p><p>\n6.) Carefully sprinkle the arrowroot or cornstarch onto the fruit, stirring vigorously to prevent clumping. Allow to cook an additional couple of minutes, until the mixture has thickened just a bit. Remove from heat, and pour into a container. \n</p><p>\n7.) Put the coconut milk base and jam into the fridge - both need to chill for a bit, at least twelve hours, ideally 24 or more. \n</p><p>\n8.) Climb a tree, read a book, explore nature. Go to work? You do you, boo boo. \n</p><p>\n9.) When all ingredients are thoroughly chilled, follow the directions on your ice cream maker! When there are five - ten minutes left, add the jam, and allow to incorporate completely. \n</p><p>\n10.) Eat ice cream in February. Don't let THE MAN tell you what to do. \n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2df","name":"ice cream","slug":"ice-cream"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","name":"vegan","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","name":"sugarrush","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e0","name":"coconut milk","slug":"coconut-milk"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e1","name":"berries","slug":"berries"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e2","name":"summertime","slug":"summertime"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e3","name":"sweet treats","slug":"sweet-treats"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e4","name":"fight the power","slug":"fight-the-power"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e5","name":"i stand with planned parenthood","slug":"i-stand-with-planned-parenthood"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e6","name":"and black lives matter","slug":"and-black-lives-matter"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e7","name":"and native nations","slug":"and-native-nations"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e8","name":"power to the people","slug":"power-to-the-people"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"coconut-berry-ice-cream","previous":{"html":"<p>I konw this post can't come close to as sweet as the one Anagha wrote this week.

But of course my inner Dory came out and I forgot to upload all the tantalizing pictures I took. A specific friend of mine, <em>cough cough Breane</em>, had requested the recipe so I TOTALLY apologize for my brain fart and promise I'll post it next week! But until then, you'll have to bear with me and enjoy this post instead :).</p>\n<p>So personally, I think my mom is the QUEEN of making banana bread. Like, seriously. Her banana bread the most glorious thing since, well, sliced bread (badum chhhhhhhhh). It's the perfect combination soft and moist and not too sweet. Of course, my banana bread can never live up to that standard but, hey, I can try!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/kvkxvgrndzsbsfjbpa938jq142jrlgpl.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>One thing I've learned about all of my mom's recipes is that her measurements aren't always... Exact. She always shows me measurements using the length of her fingers. Problem is we have different sized hands AND how do you quantify that measurement so that you can replicate it? I've tried SO many times to get teaspoon measurements for everything but can't say I've been entirely successful. This is the sole reason I haven't been able to make my food taste like my mom's food.</p>\n<p>Anyways, a girl can try right? Now back to her mind-BLASTING banana bread.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://cdn.meme.am/instances/55172211.jpg\" alt=\"Insert Russell Peters Gif Here\"></p>\n<p>Many of my friends are aware that I don't particularly have a sweet tooth. I mean sure I get cravings on occasion, however, banana bread has always been one of my favorite things, mainly because it's just the right level of sweetness. It has a strong taste of vanilla and of course banana! What could be better?!</p>\n<p>Once when I was having said cravings, I really really wanted to eat my mom's banana bread. So I decided to do my own take on her recipe, I know already going downhill, by adding zucchini and carrot. You know, hiding a little bit of healthy things in there to make you feel better about eating desserts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fk4kesqhxueed5q00j41f9gbjib2vgwo.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It actually came out pretty good, not quite mom level, but still pretty amazing. I may have eaten an embarrassingly large number of these muffins.

I made these margaritas last year for a Cinco de Mayo celebration at my cousin's place. Technically it was Seis de Mayo because May 5th last year was a Tuesday and everyone was busy that day. These were a HUGE hit and best part is that when you run out of strawberries you can just use more lime juice and make plain margaritas. It's the best.</p>\n<p>In case you needed more convincing to actually listen to that song:</p>\n<p><em>&quot;But there's booze in the blender, and soon it will render that frozen concoction that helps me hang on.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Yeah...
