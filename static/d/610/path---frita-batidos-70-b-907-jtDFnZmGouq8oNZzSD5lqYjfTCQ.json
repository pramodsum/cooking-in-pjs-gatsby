It is a small cuban street food restaurant in downtown Ann Arbor. While it may be a slight walk from the University of Michigan campus, many students make the trek despite any ridiculous weather conditions to get a bite of these burgers.</p>\n<p>They have the one of the most delicious, insanely huge and jam packed burgers I’ve ever eaten in my life. No matter the patty you want inside your burger, whether it be black bean, chicken, or chorizo, you’re bound to get a tasty concoction which will blow your mind. Honestly I have yet to meet a person at the University of Michigan who doesn’t like their burgers.</p>\n<p>The basic burger (or Frita) is simple, just the patty between two egg buns and stuffed with fries. I also added some cilantro-lime salsa and tropical slaw to juice it up a little. Safe to say, I don’t think I would be trying to impress anyone while eating this monstrosity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7598/16243253993_f6b6d7018a_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>My brother always goes with a sunny side up egg and avocado spread on his frita. As soon as you bite into the burger, the yolk bursts, spreading that wonderful flavor into every bite thereafter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8679/16837349936_c34c5ef899_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This trip to Frita Batidos was special because we brought one of my friends here for her first time. She decided to go big or go home and made her frita “loco.” This means that they just go “loco” and add ALL of their available toppings on top of your burger: muenster, a sunny side up egg, cilantro lime salsa, tropical slaw, AND avocado spread! This is pretty much the mother of all burgers. I mean its GINORMOUS. My friend wasn’t even able to attempt to eat this with her hands. But oh was it delicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8669/16240858444_1a3f8e5341_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Don’t get me started on their garlic-cilantro fries. Frita Batidos has some of the simplest yet most amazing fries I’ve had.  I can’t even describe them, you have to try them yourself!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7588/16863220175_acd3bd5a0b_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If you are ever in Ann Arbor <strong>MAKE SURE</strong> you head to downtown to taste one of these monstrosities, these glorious monstrosities of Frita Batidos.</p>\n<p>Check them <a href=\"http://www.fritabatidos.com\">out</a>!</p>\n","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c233","name":"fries","slug":"fries"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c246","name":"carnivores","slug":"carnivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","name":"eating out","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c263","name":"frita batidos","slug":"frita-batidos"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c264","name":"burgers","slug":"burgers"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c265","name":"cuban","slug":"cuban"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c266","name":"garlic","slug":"garlic"}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"frita-batidos","previous":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8645/16430694707_4453e07de4_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Whenever I'm home, my mom sometimes sautés some vegetables and keeps them for me to use with whatever I make for lunch. Usually that ends up being some simple pasta, vegetable fajitas, or toppings on a veggie burger. This time, I figured, why not try something different and make a veggie patty using these vegetables!</p>\n<p>It ended up being some kind of frittata/omelets/burger patty thing. While I may not be entirely sure what to call it, it tasted wonderful. And to my delight, it photographed really well! I actually ate the patty by itself but you could definitely eat these inside a burger or chopped up in a salad. So many options!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8577/16636556891_1f78750ce7_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8670/16018075843_3491552743_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <span class=\"item\">\n      <h2 class=\"fn\">Quinoa Veggie Patty</h2>\n    </span>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Recipe inspired by  http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/epic-crispy-quinoa-burgers-topped-sweet-potato-fries-beer-caramelized-onions-gruyere/</em></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup cooked red quinoa</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup chopped mushroom</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup sliced zucchini</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup sliced squash</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup sliced red onion</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 handful baby spinach</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp red pepper flakes or dash of cayenne</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">salt and pepper to taste</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">lime slices for garnishing</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">chopped green onion for garnishing</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        Mix all ingredients together and roll into medium-sized balls.

One of my favorite bands, Train, partnered with a California winery to make a line of wines named after some of their most famous songs! What could be better than that!</p>\n<p>This was a great wine for me and my friends, especially because we all have different preferences when it comes to wine. I prefer a really deep spicy red, whereas most of my friends like drier whites or dessert wines. Surprisingly, this wine solved most of our dilemmas. Each glass is smooth, sweet and spicy, but doesn't lean too far in either direction. It has something for all shades of wine lovers! (Plus it doesn't hurt that it's under $10) It's a college wine lover's dream! :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8782/17033305629_16faa89701_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Drops of Jupiter is not even the only type of wine that the Save Me San Francisco Wine Co makes. They also make Calling All Angels, California 37, Bulletproof Picasso, Hella Fine, and Soul Sister.</p>\n<p>Just pour yourself a glass, blast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Xf-Lesrkuc\">Drops of Jupiter</a>, and take a trip back to the 90's!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m33pmsMyUY1qflcm5o1_500.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"Did you fall for a shooting star?","slug":"did-you-fall-for-a-shooting-star","published_at":"21 April, 2015","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8782/17033305629_16faa89701_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c242","slug":"giggle-juice"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c247","slug":"wine"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c248","slug":"drops-of-jupiter"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c249","slug":"train"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c24a","slug":"red-wine"}]}}}
