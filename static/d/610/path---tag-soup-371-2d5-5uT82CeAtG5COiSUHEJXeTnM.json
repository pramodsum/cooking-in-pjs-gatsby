It’s part of fall. I don’t go for pumpkin everything, but as\nsoon as fall starts, I pull out boots, sweaters, and the ingredients for soup.\nThe thing is, Sumu won’t drink soup unless it’s pho, whereas I will drink any\nsoup you put before me, so this was a bit of a solo adventure.\n\nI made this soup while bugging Sumu with text after text regarding my soup\nadventure. She continued to inform me that she didn’t like soup (which I’ve\nactually known for quite a while now) and I continued bothering her with\ndescriptions of roasting vegetables and the warm veggie-y soup-y smells coming\nfrom my oven.\n\nI’m not going to lie to you; this is a simple soup, but it takes a few hours to\nprepare. There’s the cutting and arranging, the sprinkling and drizzling, the\nlovely roasting, the blending, and the simmering. But this is mostly passive\ncooking, and in the end, you get this gorgeous orangey-red soup which is made\nentirely with whole heart-healthy foods. It’s old fashioned, it’s got a bit of a\nbite from the pepper and the chilies, and it tastes great with toast and olive\noil, with a dash of cilantro for garnish.\n\nThis is the perfect fall soup; it mimics the lovely turning of the leaves\noutside, and puts you in the mind for roaring fires, thick nubby socks, and\ncrusty brown bread.\n\n * \n *   Three red bell peppers\n *   Chili peppers (to taste) \n *   Two carrots\n *   Two medium-sized onions\n *   Half a sweet potato\n *   Ten Roma tomatoes (approx. three lbs) \n *   Black Pepper (to taste) \n *   Two tbsp. olive oil\n *   Salt (to taste) \n *   Chili powder (to taste) \n *   One tbsp dry basil \n *   One half cup cashews \n\nSo to be totally honest, I made this recipe up as I went along. I knew I wanted\na spicy soup with tons of roasted tomatoes, and I just decided to add other\nvegetables as I went along. So, if you don’t like any of the stuff mentioned\nabove, just swap it out for something you do like. I’m sure many varieties of\nsquash would taste amazing in this soup, and if you’re a pumpkin everything\nsorta fall person, just roast that along with everything else! I am also a gal\nwho LOVES her chilies. I love spicy food. I cannot overstress this point, and\nthat was the biggest reason I added cracked pepper, chili powder, and raw\nchilies with a liberal hand. If you are less in love with fiery food, by all\nmeans use only one or two of these things (if you take one thing out, take out\nthe chili powder) and simple adjust to your family’s taste. Keep in mind that\nwe’ll be adding water at the final stage, so the spice and veggies will be\ndiluted just a bit.\n\nNow, to the actual recipe!\n\nBefore you do anything, soak those cashews in water – just set them in a bowl so\nthey’re just covered and cover the bowl with a plate or something. Let sit\nundisturbed until ready for use. Next, set your oven to preheat to 350 degrees.\n\nNow, get your veggies out and cut and arrange them onto baking trays. I left my\nbell peppers whole and stuffed my chilies inside to ensure that the chilies\nwouldn’t burn. I cut my onions into quarters, my carrots in half, my sweet\npotato into thick medallions, and all my tomatoes in half. Depending on the size\nof your veggies you may choose to go bigger or smaller – it’s really up to you –\njust make sure that many of your veggies are close in size to one another, so\nthat they cook at approximately similar rates. Over the top of your veggies,\nsprinkle olive oil, salt, basil, cracked pepper, and chili powder. If you like\nother spices and wanted to add those as well/instead, go ahead! This is YOUR\nSOUP – feel the cooking genius in you come alive as you play with flavor\ncombinations.\n\nSlide your baking trays into the oven, and settle in for the hardest part; the\nwaiting. Your veggies will roast for over an hour – mine took right around an\nhour and fifteen minutes. You want to roast until your bell peppers are all but\ncollapsed, your onions and tomatoes are shriveling (the tomato more so than the\nonion), and your sweet potatoes and carrots are soft to the touch. For many of\nyou, it is likely possible to get other work done while you wait. I’d wager that\nyou have the will power required to be productive while your oven emanates\nsmells and your kitchen comes alive.\n\nI myself turned on the oven light and parked myself right in front of it with a\ngood book, looking up frequently to check on the veggies. To each their own.\n\nAfter your vegetables are done roasting, turn off your oven and let your baking\ntrays remain inside until just cooled – about half an hour. You want the\nvegetables to be at a point where they’re still warm, but not so much so that\nyou can’t handle them with your bare hands. Now, if you have an immersion\nblender, you can put all your veggies and the cashews you’ve been soaking into\nwhatever pot you’ve set aside for soup and get to blending. I myself blended the\nveggies and cashews in batches in my blender (it took me three batches) before\npouring all of it into a soup pot with about two cups of water to start.\n\n  \n\nI stirred and added water until I was pleased with the consistency, then covered\nit and let it simmer. I stirred about every ten minutes to fully combine the\nwater and the veggies, and made last minute adjustments to taste at this stage.\nFinally, after about a half hour of chopping, an hour and fifteen of roasting, a\nhalf hour of cooling, and another half hour of blending and simmering, it was\nready. I opted for traditional grilled cheese, and garnished with a drizzle of\nolive oil and some cilantro, and welcomed fall in the best and yummiest way\npossible.","feature_image":null,"tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22b","name":"soup","slug":"soup"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22c","name":"fall","slug":"fall"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22d","name":"tomato","slug":"tomato"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"soup","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
