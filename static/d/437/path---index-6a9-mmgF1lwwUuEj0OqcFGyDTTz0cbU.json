Every Tuesday, all engineers have an event on their calendar that'll allow them to <em>hopefully</em> work quietly without any meetings or interruptions. This usually ends up meaning that almost all the engineers work from home that day. So, I'm usually happily working from home in my pajamas on Tuesdays. This ALSO means I tend to bake or cook on Tuesdays because I have more time at home.</p>\n<p>This week I decided to make Jalapeño Cheddar Beer Bread! 1) It's cheesy, spicy, and delicious and 2) Turns out beer can replace yeast in a lot of ways, except it does leave it's taste behind... so if that's not your thing just use yeast as you would with normal bread. Feel free to use a beer of your choice, I used an IPA because some friends had left some in my fridge and I don't drink those... so VOILÀ!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/gkhjbbs2e40tngmeqjhukmde6vb8hvcj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/hm0yyw0uk5phkmfgta50v14z1nfjpcka.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Jalapeño Cheddar Beer Bread</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <h4>Dough</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">3 cups Flour</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">3 tsp baking powder</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp salt</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tbsp sugar</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 can/bottle beer</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg</li>\n          <h4>Filling</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup diced jalapeño (add more if you want a little more kick)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp garlic powder</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp salt</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">8 oz cream cheese (softened)</li>\n          <h4>Toppings</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 Jalapeños thinly sliced</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Preheat the oven to 375.

To be fair... I didn't make the actual cake from scratch. I had initially and then had a few friends taste it because I was unsure. That batch was probably the worst cakes I have ever made in my entire life.... There was absolutely no way I could bring that to my friend's birthday celebration. At that point, I was running short on time so I bought some standard Duncan Hines chocolate cake mixes and made 2 small round cakes according to package instructions.</p>\n<p>Here's where the fun and experimentation started!</p>\n<p>An old fashioned is a fairly simple drink according to <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/recipes/a3880/old-fashioned-drink-recipe/\">Esquire Magazine</a>:<br>\n1 Sugar Cube<br>\n3 dashes of Angostura Bitters<br>\n1 L Club Soda<br>\n2 oz. Rye Whiskey</p>\n<p>Some people tend to garnish their drinks with orange peels and cherries to add some flair to their drink. The hard core Don Drapers will stick to their stiff drinks... but this is a cake so I had some fun with it.</p>\n<p>I decided there would be 3 components to this cake outside the base chocolate cake layers and the frosting on top.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/8filn60lmi2pezfhyyuhnwyd1vdfg6s6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"whiskeysoakedcherries\">Whiskey Soaked Cherries</h1>\n<p>This is the easiest part of the entire cake. Just stick a bunch of cherries in a jar and fill it with the whiskey/bourbon/etc of your choice. I used Jack Daniels for everything in this cake because that's what we had at home. By the time you're done with the rest of the cake, these cherries will be nice and boozy to stick on garnish the top!</p>\n<h1 id=\"candiedorangepeels\">Candied Orange Peels</h1>\n<p>This part I wasn't really creative on. I followed the <a href=\"http://bakingthegoods.com/2013/12/06/drinking-buddies-recipe-whiskey-chocolate-cake-whisky-buttercream-frosting/\">instructions in this recipe</a>! It's actually fairly painless and you can do it while you're doing the rest of the cake prep and ganache prep.</p>\n<h1 id=\"nutellawhiskeyganachefilling\">Nutella Whiskey Ganache Filling</h1>\n<p>My ganache filling ended up being a hodge podge of a few recipes I've both made before and found on the internets.</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Nutella Whiskey Ganache</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/2 cup nutella</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 can sweetened condensed milk</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Whiskey to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Confectioners sugar to thicken  if needed</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Combine the ingredients on the stove on low heat until well mixed.

If the ganache is still too thin, add some confectioner's sugar until it thickens.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Assembling this cake was pretty easy. Place a layer of cake on the plate and poke holes in it with the back of a wooden spoon. Pour ganache over until the holes are filled and a layer of ganache exists over the cake. Stack the other layer of cake on top and also poke holes in this layer. Pour just enough ganache over this layer to fill the holes. Cover the cake with your favorite vanilla/plain frosting. I prefer Duncan Hines Cream Cheese frosting but that's up to you what kind of frosting you want! Top the cake with some whiskey cherries, candied orange peels, and even some chocolate or orange peel shavings if you want.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/mufzx61sqambx3kf7gx6clftip5sozso.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/kjnx23pun0ckfiegog2ujetcd4igscbi.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/qnuzhxf19zdc4qe7tz9qhjelervhkxc4.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c28b","name":"chocolate","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c8","name":"whiskey","slug":"whiskey"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c242","name":"giggle juice","slug":"giggle-juice"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c9","name":"birthday","slug":"birthday"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c337","name":"anerica","slug":"anerica"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c338","name":"old fashioned","slug":"old-fashioned"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c339","name":"orange","slug":"orange"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c33a","name":"cherry","slug":"cherry"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c36a","uuid":"a5004992-c2ed-4f4b-beac-59baa322db49","title":"Everyone needs a 'Lil Dicky' in their life","slug":"everyone-needs-a-lil-dicky-in-their-life","published_at":"19 July, 2016","html":"<p>So recently it was one of my closest friend's, whom we lovingly call Lil Dicky, birthdays.

Take your potatoes out of the microwave, cut them in half, and put them back in the microwave for three or four  more minutes.\n        &lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;\n        4.) Shred your basil, and keep it ready. When your potatoes are done, chop them roughly into bite-sized pieces. Throw the hot potatoes into the bowl with the butter mixture, and stir until the potatoes are coated in the butter. Sprinkle with basil and eat!\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n</div></div>","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/hylt0nyiky2u1ox43pvzqs19mzp7w51x.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c311","name":"basil","slug":"basil"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c330","name":"potatoes","slug":"potatoes"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c331","name":"10 minute meals","slug":"10-minute-meals"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c332","name":"miso","slug":"miso"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c333","name":"butter","slug":"butter"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c380","uuid":"b112724c-4311-432f-81e6-540c215fce32","title":"Ba-na-na Ba-na-nana Po-ta-tooo Po-ta-to-naaaa","slug":"ba-na-na-ba-na-nana-po-ta-tooo-po-ta-to-naaaa","published_at":"05 May, 2016","html":"<p>K this second post for the week took a bit longer than expected but I finally perfected the pictures so we're good now. YAY Post #2 for the week! And that too, to celebrate one of the nerdiest holidays out there! STAR WARS DAY!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/4PbEHW8mN4xhK/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>All the wonderful puns.</p>\n<p>Also because this recipe is banana filled, I HAD the little song by the Minions from Despicable Me stuck in my head. So I figured I should share that adorableness and mental torture with you guys.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3\">\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" wmode=\"Opaque\" allowfullscreen src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sFukyIIM1XI?wmode=transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>Anyways... after being home sick for an entire week in what I consider my personal version of solitary confinement, I hit a new level of insanity. I was deprived of social interaction to such a point that I legit LOL'd at a Buzzfeed article of ridiculous snapchats for a good 20 minutes. And by LOL'd I mean curled over laughing so hard I could barely breathe. No Buzzfeed article is THAT funny. I had such bad sinus pain that working on my computer for long periods of time was pretty rough. So I decided rather than wallowing in my bed, I was going to make SOME productive use of my time... baking for you guys!</p>\n<p>I found this recipe on Pinterest a while back of <a href=\"http://www.carlsbadcravings.com/cream-cheese-stuffed-chocolate-chip-banana-coffee-cake-recipe/\">Cream Cheese Filled Chocolate Chip Banana Coffee Cake</a>. I do want to preface my recipe with this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I didn't some of the ingredients so this is my altered version for lazy bakers :)</li>\n<li>I also don't have a bundt cake pan, so mine didn't come out as gorgeous looking as this but there is one thing I CAN guarantee, which is that they came out DELICIOUS. Probably one of my favorite desserts I've ever made, next to Tiramisu and my mom's Mush Cake.</li>\n<li>I didn't have brown sugar and didn't want to bother making a second grocery store trip for that so I just didn't bother making the streusel topping that was in the original recipe. I can only imagine how much more mind blowing it would have been had I added the streusel, maybe you can make yours with it and let me know!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/1tjouximy6nxjmeaomjqkrsd4i5ouqxi.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Over the last few weeks I've been trying to figure out where in my new apartment I can do my food photography to optimize the natural light coming from my windows. In my old apartment it was extremely easy, I had giant sliding doors which brought in ALL the light and shown over pretty much my entire living room; and if that wasn't enough then I could go out onto my balcony and take the photos there! It was perfect. This week I discovered that if I angle one of my side tables properly and place the dish inside it, the light reflects off the walls of the table perfectly onto the the food and really brings out all the details in the food! I HAD FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT! Although this weird positioning did lead to some old people back pain for me because of the weird positions that I laid in on the floor to get these photos. Such is the pain for beauty.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/l2l9lmho8q088kczuewl9ll8ec4uz2b8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I mean just look at it...</p>\n<p>This is one recipe I would HIGHLY recommend you try, whether it be my interpretation or the original recipe itself. It was delicious and my coworkers and friends LOVED it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ficxwsing8l7wulb6s5v3pvs4w4grit7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Chocolate Chip Banana Cheesecake Coffee Cake </h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>If you don't have over-ripe bananas, then Carlsbad Cravings gave a great suggestion of sticking them in the oven at 325 F degrees until they're dark on the outside and soft to the touch.</em></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n        <h4>Banana Coffee Cake</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 1/4 cups all purpose flour</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/4 tsp baking powder</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/4 tsp baking soda</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp salt</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tsp cinnamon</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup butter, softened</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/2 cup sugar</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 large eggs</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">4 large bananas, over-ripe and mashed</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 1/4 cups non-fat plain yogurt (or greek yogurt)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">3/4 cup chocolate chips</li>\n        <h4>Cheesecake filling</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">16 oz cream cheese, softened</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup reserved batter (from banana coffee cake above)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup sugar</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F and spray your pan with nonstick cooking spray and flour the inside of your pan.</p>\n        <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Set aside.</p>\n        <p>Using a hand mixer, beat the butter and sugar together until fluffy. Add the eggs in one at a time and beat until blended. Mix in the vanilla and bananas until just combined.</p>\n        <p>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the yogurt. Beat until just combined. Measure out 1/2 cup of batter and keep aside for the cheesecake filling. Stir in the chocolate chips into the remaining batter and keep aside. Measure out about 1 cup of the batter with chocolate chips and keep aside to layer on top of the cheesecake filling. Pour the remaining batter into your pan.</p>\n        <p>In a separate bowl, mix together the 1/2 cup batter you set aside earlier with the rest of the cheesecake filling ingredients on high speed until smooth and creamy.</p>\n        <p>Spread the cheesecake filling on top of the current layer batter in the pan. It's okay if it sinks in a bit, this cake is much more moist than the original recipe so the cheesecake layer is more variable in size. Pour the top layer of batter on top of the cheesecake filling. If you made a streusel, now is the time to sprinkle it on top.</p>\n        <p>Bake for 55-60 minutes at 350 degrees F or until toothpick inserted comes out clean (ignoring the melted chocolate chips and any possible cream cheese that still may not be solid).
