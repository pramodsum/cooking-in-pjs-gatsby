For example, I (Anu) spent half the year in India, but you guys never read about my adventures with street food, or my quest to find the best masala dosas in Bangalore. While Sumu kept you all a bit more updated on her goings on, the fact is, we both want to do better.</p>\n<p>So with that in mind, we're challenging ourselves to post once a week each in 2016! You'll be getting a new post from Sumu on Wednesdays, and Anu on Sundays. We'll be sharing bits of our lives and kitchens all year, and in the interest of accountability, we've decided to implement some penalties for failure to deliver.</p>\n<p>Offense 1: Donate ten dollars to a slush fund that we will donate to a charity at the end of the year! Every other penalty on the list is also accompanied by this, so there's potential for us to donate 80 at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Offense 2: The innocent party gets to pick 1 song for you to listen to during your entire commute.</p>\n<p>Offense 3: The innocent party gets to take a picture or pictures with puppies and send it to the offender, to show them what they're missing.</p>\n<p>Offense 4: The Chopped Challenge; the innocent party assigned the offending party a random list of ingredients, from which they must produce and consume a meal. The production of said meal must be videotaped for the innocent party's viewing pleasure.</p>\n<p>Any offenses over and above this will result in the offending party having to complete a dare that is entirely up to the whim of the innocent party. So that's pretty terrifying. All posts will also include the tag #challenge2016 so you can also check up on us.</p>\n<p><strong>May the force be with you</strong></p>\n<p>We hope you're as excited as we are :)<br>\nSumu and Anu</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VZbmOFixe3qVzvC-U7QLvsJcUQeV79GACQl0DPf4gIEKj5oFw27pplxZG6e1UwB7s_FujTfxfHLTyyyLxZlceDET3cC5gD0aItG1FYd_Dl3d1Vo5KWKx5cOJMcvvEjvbNx3-CHg90QmtpBpwjaJvZ7qX6L16KXL1j-nl1JUOuP_HbuqTTLdH0v2FoABqTx6Cmlp5DIvvzZ5YJwxsdmBX9a3uA2mhKdPDd_7covcnCiXsSMakXWaDPFBl5_J2B8joh-lgKgRfACEZrQSLTpPeULuOT5cJuEmxqw-MPQNb50K3P7M5vHgqL1o34_uVf9m5FLevjSWsaz-Ykx_FXq20bTABd10Q7X4P0Bal0NIYMYQ3vaK3Xdi1qcrGtrLhd6C4Yag0d-aq2iqEIj6T39RtlKWMG9jfJWGDpnqGmTn4QDPf3oP-2It0WMFM8TcGvlKOPF41SIHmTpSGmt0Lvc4vpqYHYJ8IuH5KDyJmi87gycu2hiMeqG9Lb1eX971UPP4hXwDfcAyWK2s1mWmmCPsglA4SHXtUntmi7xsfPsIfbxt4VEpf-FrzqtjqlWQaSzrC1Ceu_g=w353-h546-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>NOTE: I (Sumu) have done a complete redesign of the blog so please email me @ <a href=\"mailto:sumu@cookinginpjs.com\">sumu@cookinginpjs.com</a> if you've got any thoughts/bugs/general comments about it so I can address them ASAP!

A lot of people attended and learned a lot about what Box is doing to improve the gender disparity in tech. Sadly, we overestimated how much granola we needed and ended up with 2 GIANT bowls of granola left over.</p>\n<p>In my head, it seemed like I could bake those into some variety of oatmeal cookies and breakfast bars and be done with it. No matter how much granola I used, it seemed like it was never going to end! Thankfully after making 3-4 batches of these oatmeal bars I finished 1 bowl, but I ended up making some dark chocolate fruit and nut clusters as well (post coming soon).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sGP7DG-ogISOqpn5cRBPGfuyssXcg4RgvQrrHS9UhVFMELUH4_UZmo210YRzTkLpdPGWv5x2ZFM4jExGZQWfocYpQGZdZiHKQEKg_pqMyhN-So95F9-dypl_FJpWELhBfs86l7Rrk3qWGPTpStQ2mG0CXPGYFOdcO6eQmaDVSSRKcHBhyWGXjPdALsaiblUo92stdgRYxOSGCk7Mti2VVkQekoIIf1z_qxwYD63gjXrQUKzap7dodLYFyONtcohBmOK4iEFcCs5Y3Wtl9J9J8dw6uZzJ1qLmDI_OT7Pt_vGAgDYXeQC-C_jAD4BBiIS4jJUAr-Auuh75uxjDm6RsGFl211_fuQ91zKMO-DMCW_i3H6tQHGCUpGDbuFNID-Tf5BZDIAiCIom05iwRRAt9I5CU6tx_e_Ppjj7dBAiKOLOCQA96jWOUdFkqw5ClRrZ7xvmdX9OR_Odhx-04FI6_Ugi9BPUFpx24NvgIuaOiQc6efIcEYOwsOWtycdKE1xhIjAo613H3h9zv3EUO09L8M1DSPgixNHUwMZwr6aOdOl1r=w1440-h960-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In all honesty, these cookie bars were SO much better than those chocolate clusters (as scrumptious as those look). The crumbly-ness and chocolatey-ness of these bars complemented each other perfectly. I've actually saved all the extra crumbles to top ice scream sundaes. Think about how delicious that would be!!! Now that you're officially drooling thinking about that, here's the recipe.</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie Bars</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">3 cups granola (or oats)</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1¼ cup butter, melted</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 cups chocolate chips</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 cups flour</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1½ cups brown sugar</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp baking soda</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp salt</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1½ tbsp vanilla</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">2 eggs</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a cookie sheet with non-stick cooking spray.</p>\n        <p>Add everything but the chocolate chips into a bowl and mix until just combined. I don't have a standing mixer or this would have been much easier and less messier. Stir in the chocolate chips.</p>\n        <p>Spread the batter into the baking dish. Bake for 25 minutes or until a tester comes out with just a few moist crumbs. Bars should look slightly underdone. Let cool 1 hour before cutting into bars. (But let's be honest here... I couldn't wait more than 10 minutes)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Because the granola I used wasn't very sweet it didn't overly sweeten the bars either, which was something I preferred. Similarly, using brown sugar instead of normal granular sugar kept the bars less sweet. Make sure not to overcook the bars or they won't be as gloriously crumbly!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uQrAyDivSMbcmNtvHNBFu_QdSkQPcf2sZgjnRyK68wk8V9SYj8q2L4Zjl6gG2qsOnHao_a5nTKX9qm7T76p6eGY5ZaLABI6SBgCxTsdh3grdS_IvVj2xMRqvp7A5oX8ZksEX80b_6stHwWjiPs-kz014FANeFRWv8x8icGwd0wJ5w7s_hWQnEAEwUiEEX91_Uxb0SxlNsXJTbhlCoCqh_HyxKUJRmoR5LQ9LcTF87CSBz2rFfQHLlgZC1qk61bVwoSy_YnlFKVR5Izcx3yPmu2vp0zx183nfiNmZdKbJ60mc8Jm_jlmk1Z-KtqmdAVSxaFZ6sqtPOsggjwXEZIH0hFHZOPhgX6zfyzH_vLQ0tWPQa1OUAmMOWp_zm3-3umJ1tGTifgjs0RlrqxiuTWfjfSr8POYttNJSh7m1DzHRT5prbidF1SQIYAMJfzUIKJlA7nprMc_VraNXjf3ZRFTbirubqyuNvj3CQAU4OTHchOAfTg0JLIrqD82Od4P5RNHn8UvUSACLgNkiWC6H4NIhZPsyiS-dqiNk2xSa7HROpk_K=w1440-h1080-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mUbMEZZQ3oGBxeqw6y0s1Ee_WGOWWcNnZ3zeRT0ExYBdCKJNgdcj3PNwxOxBf8Pt1eBEcr-bRArg7ZtA-hrAh3IEfd1avJxPewZ2QooCl9ibPMd4zcTEmQVjd0FDpLWCwqhZdtCCC0mmMk3AD7UF8n_WINUEybW63C8CE0ttVFJzdD4edmr4H-3BapJLd2kRdfG5ifRodUO5KkZsLcQtcGUbTYIDJWzs3J4Ijb-G5Ax80OQdgHLlhjUSpGJ9uQNJ_-JkpgypKRGE5OpK3_OFAqYOq_AYQvaEkz9WmOUeLjI_n4kXlJGUjiu5-rybvT7Oswc8iSxqedjskMlFZFfCmL1A_K3ZRx7foBC8s1gdnigzUJU48Dw7lPCjp9-7Gz3VaBeq6bdzQL-HurwFbxwUF16k5yxvZ_h1tett6jpaiADX5frvd9ZTK8TdSqWdGsnbT8zNLLSBPRYYeuOZWxp45HL-kZrYaqcvBBaa900-A4BQFzmUzP6KO8PsfOlieW3lzVG_fUrXacU4JlYCdLBa7q2_YSoh_GMFX5HEwCX23nSo=w1440-h1080-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"What to do when you have the World's Supply of Granola at your Disposal","slug":"what-to-do-when-you-have-the-worlds-supply-of-granola-at-your-disposal","published_at":"08 October, 2015","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2lPmzUu82FpK-bF10uC-AJpZ8xIWniOm2cCYIRfno-lDDrHJp5zBVeNAPCaaBZMwDVZ_wv9-tiO4OVMUyv90BGrb3cpDcawOhIjnkkM5FtDsXUzWoa9hfnflZZ7wgFq13L44Si8-D4RHJ17O8KP8aKIOKPDpYr_MbISDtZtCZh9enMUhh-1esqJO16NL8-suXV6hO6JlMnyzjQwFNeww9sUlZuwprBxko5kC1YvUsa1Vk69b02093F_4JuCdlWORn_SJA97gLJzvlnDVI3HIZYQ41o0e2JJA0SEdMgv9PRki8xj4fJtI_E2W_DdiYKPg3AulAqqO0Qx9i9q9pMjUZEiNmjzAFa_BcAWYSPRb27EM8s8BujPmrAWM8AxNpE2mjd0OJRddfyJlkVXZyu0j6PJizFjtEP43x6uSPcgL5SrNdACc4g8EVrth-qPHxy2eOnhYgEtc-wR80827fG_pKrzy8nwUfVmIEMbtOHRf1zD06ZNVPjqADJ8CSbxv5vOAP-DZNKtUnK4AViSQA8OpchyEQRquO5A8NeFuN9qKZLez=w1440-h1080-no","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c28b","slug":"chocolate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29e","slug":"oatmeal"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29f","slug":"granola"}]},"next":{"html":"<p>I made these cookies quite a while ago, right after one of my final exams.
