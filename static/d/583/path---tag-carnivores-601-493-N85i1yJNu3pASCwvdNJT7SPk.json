I know right?! So awesome. You can thank me later. AND to make things better... instead of sharing just a single song... I'm going to gift you with a whole playlist of my favorite songs from Coachella!</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A1217494097%3Aplaylist%3A7vHswNAsv4lLIjCNrjvzeZ\" width=\"auto\" max-width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>So very typical of me, I didn't double check my flight timings when booking so I ended up flying out to LAX a whole 10 hours before the rest of my group. I decided to start the trip out right, eggs Benedict and a mimosa at the airport with a side of Gilmore Girls.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/egnkhg8zefh3rl0xkh1co74s074cr4c0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Usually 10 hours stranded at an airport is a bummer, but there are worse places to get stranded than LAX. It kind of ended up working out for me because I took my camera and explored! I walked from Santa Monica Pier to Venice Beach and soaked in the gorgeous SoCal sun.</p>\n<p>In Santa Monica, I stopped at the Lobster for some AMAZING crab cake. Seriously, probably the best I've ever had in my life.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/0i02gxp1jckp0svdv6cu8wi5ewctzsvm.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In Venice Beach, I decided to have a lighter option and enjoyed some Burrata and Beets at Larry's Bar &amp; Grill.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/6dynwvyb7q9fon9luvmogmd3wbei2szk.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The most adventurous meal was at dinner with a friend at Wurstküche. We enjoyed some cold beers and Rattlesnake Sausages. It honestly didn't taste much different from other sausages and was actually pretty good but I can't say I'd comfortably eat that again.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/aypjyy5024v7hcfqhqa4dwl3x6injkm7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The weekend was filled with new musical obsessions, including Zhu &amp; Flume (seriously check out that playlist ^), new friends, delicious eats, and lots and lots of dust. We danced our asses off to Zedd and Calvin Harris, reveled in the unfair flawlessness that is Ellie Goulding, and sang our hearts out with Akon, Sean Paul, and Nico&amp;Vinz during Matoma's set.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/duq94s8q18b3qklwj730gkuu2l5szcpm.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ie4gkxnr4yruv5grnjyaya1iunyoj6pm.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I came back home the following Monday sunburned (what happens when you wander around LA without sunscreen) and exhausted out of my mind; Cue sickness.</p>\n<p>This was my first year attending Coachella, every instagrammer's and basic bitch's haven. Of course I had to have ONE basic picture myself to commemorate the experience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/z7gfp3dlql2f2wag911y4lvsznp2q06v.jpg\" alt=\"insert basic watermelon picture here\"></p>\n<p>Coachella is also a GREAT place for foodies. While you needed to be a VIP to get access to some of the tastiest and more exclusive food, there was plenty of delicious options to spare. Looking back at my food photos, I realize that I basically survived off fries. Just fries. And obviously watermelon, because it IS Coachella. But these fries were no ordinary fries my friends. They were all loaded with various toppings and delicious goodness.</p>\n<p>Veggie Monster Fries with lots of types of slaw and jalapeños!<br>\n<img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/z4ge00bngygbfezcdyv3x4gdsve5p72u.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Vegetarian Poutin Fries with cheese curds!<br>\n<img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/uyr9jkumf8n2a6mzue6bxdrimbfblro2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Crab Fries!

While you are certainly welcome bring booze into the mix, these are instructions for figuring out an all food crawl; it's an excellent way to explore a new city!</p>\n<p>It's also a really good way to spend a couple of hours with friends without spending a ton of money; if you're on a budget, this is a great way to try lots of different food, and see quite a bit, without breaking the bank. We each paid for one entree at one place, and it came out perfectly for us!</p>\n<p>First, you need a walkable city. I myself did this with my friends Eden and Hafsa in San Francisco, the day I last left Sumu.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/nswhwh2moi2lyt9ett886237vfike5xh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Second, do some preliminary research. Don't actually choose all the places you want to go, but choose 1 or 2, or find a neighborhood that has a ton of stuff you're interested in exploring. We found ourselves wandering around the Mission District, ogling wall art and talking about gentrification.</p>\n<p>Third, set off on your journey! Start with a place you know you want to go to; we started with Philz Coffee, which also let us sip and wander for a bit before we found real food.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ifb3j8uif6p154mugitpvrh06kyjpziu.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Over the course of the next several hours, we tried Thai food, Mexican food, Vietnamese food, and, finally, Ethiopian food. At each place, we would choose one entree to share, so that in the end, we all got to try tons of yummy food for relatively little!</p>\n<p>We were having so much fun we failed to take a lot of pictures, but this is definitely one of those days that I'll be remembering for quite a while! If you do a food crawl, let me know how it goes!</p>\n<p>And, if you're in DC or San Francisco and you're interested in doing this, hit Sumu or I up!

I made my first solo move as an adult. I packed up my apartment in Sunnyvale and <em>finally</em> moved to San Francisco. If you're wondering why I picked this specific Van Morrison song, I felt like it was meant to be. The song Saint Dominic's Preview has a lot of references to the Saint Dominic's Church on the intersection of Bush and Steiner in San Francisco, literally a block from my new apartment. Everyday when I walk back from the bus stop after work, I pass by this gorgeous church and admire it. It just felt right to pick this song for the post. :)</p>\n<p>However, if that song isn't your speed and you want something a little more sultry, try this one by Carmen McRae.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:4jsrzfNVVFAtNtMPVpFdwo\" width=\"auto\" max-width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>I've had a blast since moving out here. I get to see my friends almost every day. I have a wonderful new roommate who I've known since college. Even after only a week, I've got to attend all sorts of weird and yet awesome things! This was an art exhibit that was installed right outside City Hall over this past week.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ssreqfxw68u26d0ezcxhj7m41o5rtp8x.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/dzi45k6s5vrfkhd5s4tymemg446eu46v.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>And best of all, I get to cook with my friends, both old and new! I went over to a friend's place yesterday night and me and a new friend, Kerry, began to make some DELICIOUS fresh spring rolls. Granted, the recipe for this has been posted on this site before, the food could never have been more delicious and different. We filled these with lettuce, shrimp, vermicelli noodles, and more! We even made some peanut sauce to dip the rolls in (just mix some hoisin sauce and creamy peanut butter together). Simple, yet delicious!</p>\n<p>We did have some mishaps during the process. San Francisco kitchens are usually TINY, as are a lot of the apartments. My friend's kitchen is very much sizable for 1 person cooking. When you try to squeeze 4 people in there, chaos ensues.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We were lied to about the presence of peanut butter, hence sending the boys on one trip to the store</li>\n<li>Kerry and I weren't aware that the pasta strainer LOCKED onto the pot we were cooking the noodles in. This unfortunately caused ALL of the noodles to fall into the sink, hence a second trip to the store to get more noodles</li>\n<li>The boys may never let us live this down. Highly unlikely after all the sass given while Kerry and I made their dinner.</li>\n<li>They showed me this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y7Vq9749s8\">amazing group that performs acoustic covers of popular songs</a>... MIND BLOWING. I'm not gonna lie I may have teared up a bit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While I may not have an explicit recipe for you, I have plenty of photos and full stomachs as proof.

There are so many different varieties of food I love making and it makes no sense for me to maintain a kitchen stocked with ALL the ingredients for whenever I'd want to make any of these things. Usually when I post recipes, I try to use the ingredients I already have, can make substitutes, or keep the grocery shopping to a minimum. #LivinLaVidaLazy</p>\n<p>I didn't have some of the specific ingredients so I used a bunch of more commonly available substitutes and tasted it every now and then if I needed to make adjustments. My recipe is roughly based on a recipe from <a href=\"http://www.gimmesomeoven.com/homemade-bbq-sauce-recipe/\">Gimme Some Oven</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.foodrenegade.com/homemade-worcesterschire-sauce/\">Food Renegade</a>. However, doubt me as you will, I had my friend who's grown up in Texas taste test my sauce and he loved it. You don't mess with Texans and their BBQ sauce... they know their sauce. He did give me one suggestion that I'll pass along to you guys, which was to add Liquid Smoke. Personally I have no idea what that is, but apparently it is life changing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/q2bizza1yo67mf7ke4n847seddnm2uf4.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/w9jluoe11rs0l2tern4fe91qkw8mnlzj.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Homemade BBQ Sauce</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup molasses</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup mustard</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup red wine (or apple cider vinegar)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp paprika</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp garlic powder</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp freshly ground garlic</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">salt to taste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">a few pinches of cayenne pepper to taste</li>\n          <h4>Tomato Sauce + Paste</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">3 Roma tomatoes, pureed</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup ketchup (or puree 1 more tomato with some salt)</li>\n          <h4>\"Worcestershire\" Sauce</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup red wine (or apple cider vinegar)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tbsp molasses</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tbsp tamarind paste</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Juice of 1 lime</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 tsp ground clove</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 tsp garlic</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 tsp chili powder</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Whisk all the ingredients together in a saucepan over medium heat.

I just devoured it on various types of crackers I had at home. Best thing about this sauce is that you can use it in SO many different ways. Not only did I use it for pulled chicken, but we coated some fried tofu with the sauce to take our fresh rolls to a whole new level.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/txb7aup0o1j84cpq3ihiexnvwev1qhha.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/fioewthw07p9j1xq43a87jt6m61qgfjk.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ph5xt6ynrfqy9k96ey3envqni9s144p6.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/9rqxf3dpvx4qrfmuuqcosdfr6sjjv3v2.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/kqopbbjcm03630m09ngp3rwrz80cic29.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ra36zozb7as5vdbnv29dogkxx2kly1wg.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/9rqxf3dpvx4qrfmuuqcosdfr6sjjv3v2.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fc","name":"bbq","slug":"bbq"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fd","name":"southern","slug":"southern"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c246","name":"carnivores","slug":"carnivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fe","name":"sauce","slug":"sauce"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ff","name":"comfort","slug":"comfort"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c300","name":"country","slug":"country"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c37e","uuid":"a95f8d2d-1470-4844-aa6e-784a730e7ce2","title":"Estoy Cantando","url":"https://cookinginpjs.herokuapp.com/estoy-cantando/","published_at":"06 January, 2016","html":"<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/5llh0jdygar2h4ykutwryhmtfxx99eec.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Anyone who has had the <em>honor</em> of being in my presence this week knows that I've been playing one song on repeat.

Being the ever so responsible adult that I am, I decided that I could muster enough patience to cook lunches and dinners for my brother a few times, or at least while I was working from home. We braved it out to a farmers market and brought back a collection of various vegetables without any idea of what to make. While brainstorming ideas my brother decided that since he was spending a week in California, he was going to try and eat Mexican food for each and every meal.</p>\n<p>My next step was to figure out what kind of Mexican dish to make when all I had bought was stir fry vegetables. Voilà! MEXICAN &quot;STIR FRY&quot;! Or I guess as normal people call it... TOSTADA BOWLS!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ve6cm0UWi2klfKNBucW5RQaGauUXPwneEc0sHfvpURDlY3SWKBfcYAQLCJK3Q2I7uSZdo2ulwfO1mmXmKWbZ56btcUQ7m3i5eay2g4qi-f4FaQtX-vYoiSZHueaiJjhMGIWs-sVJY68eBCXO2Aj5ctKAmXCHAKEriVCYSAMdo4ThgSXyixQxiO7-FNwcDa9fhjyVdSm2euwAOJC3l92hTmva72-XsHiX4ir8ElyAZFpvOS9nQ1j0kDCzfx0J4nYPfKAzJp7wDVWQUkQsDW90frbjnFfpEeUw_gl_n2DzR7x9r5tbjC4I9M1OqHmlgp-mhJZ46I8L2olUEqEcXkvcRiVPJFNlfMJyx4YRU5KPR8G921KOOy_0l_68mWlZSdTlIH6-De6xwXGCL9lR2sQ-CIxdIFGumGYlH35G8I8bo2GHZw5eG2org0oKpi0QYd8373sOFzMMElqSdAKsatEayenx7iGKBPLngoAK3m5cH5b7IxHHymlLi-baaZRFwgiqMqyiH2l7xu2htVeC_zTfpPjJNr-_0eDiAJmh1I5pEykrD5Sy44vuiUjnbicZMeTC4hn_tg=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There's not really a recipe for this post because honestly I kind of made it up on the spot. BUT I can give you some bits and pieces of what went in this so you can make your own variation of this dish at home! (I KNOW, how sweet of me.)</p>\n<p>This dish is essentially a layer of cilantro lime rice, refried beans, vegetables sautéd fajita style, salmon (totally optional and honestly kinda ruined the dish for me, my brother's vegetarian one was on point), guacamole, sour cream and cotija cheese a.k.a. fancy Mexican cheese. Plus you can throw some chopped green onions on top to make it look all pretty and fancy.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CeNqsYp63uvCaplae3zBaDNLdex2SHlc0IMJSkMjUmFjsv59YL92AaEDRfHi6nIko0QnXSz8DBH81h1C0rvKzWi4GatpUqH3aT2QXl1ws6cH6QqprP6Enh2oNuG2VegDD94fbVobszPLMNhKqMw-CsTpJcyjH-Jb8hvmJNfmalrGrUhGVZZijJBAUM-IAE5sFkFBPRHdDtdLBMV_DZh7VHm40qWDhdQyzu7RJd_uGhmOcecFMuvr8zlSlx8G4zotPn2E6qRxUpExV8JHKsbZAlpB443QUuMVdJ6gHjR3xgp_3YOaxY2lopHf19vQ7x7oJHe5UaFqRrLK1eVUBETrB_Jc1dmWJS-LVOk8f6mjkbJt0v01VmxHTdw5HmvikvgTOXPTN5ha0w-VX1KhLxd5hohLEGei2FNAc_gCX1cZWzmxiy2uj6vZoeqKDg8VQgjYJGTbzmHKenzKWsI0GfX4wd0wcsMlEWcETm0_t8A6aFXQpXuw5im8BxIPfd-csF8tzSGUEKVCwkl1KahFAkwEeLPtMCmxhlSo1I-m91MXYv7aVws1Diu8quyH-ZLVcE5jzXzO6A=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I've always loved making Mexican food. It's so flavorful and deliciously rewarding every time! Every single part of a burrito/taco/bowl is overflowing with unique tastes that seem extremely complicated and intricate. I'll let you in on a little secret...I use the same seasoning to cook every single part of any Mexican dish I make. Whether it be the refried beans or fajita vegetables, it's all various spice levels of the same recipe. I'm sure that's not how authentic Mexican food is made, but hey...mine tastes pretty damn good too.</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Sumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to mess around with the proportions of each ingredient!

It is a small cuban street food restaurant in downtown Ann Arbor. While it may be a slight walk from the University of Michigan campus, many students make the trek despite any ridiculous weather conditions to get a bite of these burgers.</p>\n<p>They have the one of the most delicious, insanely huge and jam packed burgers I’ve ever eaten in my life. No matter the patty you want inside your burger, whether it be black bean, chicken, or chorizo, you’re bound to get a tasty concoction which will blow your mind. Honestly I have yet to meet a person at the University of Michigan who doesn’t like their burgers.</p>\n<p>The basic burger (or Frita) is simple, just the patty between two egg buns and stuffed with fries. I also added some cilantro-lime salsa and tropical slaw to juice it up a little. Safe to say, I don’t think I would be trying to impress anyone while eating this monstrosity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7598/16243253993_f6b6d7018a_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>My brother always goes with a sunny side up egg and avocado spread on his frita. As soon as you bite into the burger, the yolk bursts, spreading that wonderful flavor into every bite thereafter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8679/16837349936_c34c5ef899_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This trip to Frita Batidos was special because we brought one of my friends here for her first time. She decided to go big or go home and made her frita “loco.” This means that they just go “loco” and add ALL of their available toppings on top of your burger: muenster, a sunny side up egg, cilantro lime salsa, tropical slaw, AND avocado spread! This is pretty much the mother of all burgers. I mean its GINORMOUS. My friend wasn’t even able to attempt to eat this with her hands. But oh was it delicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8669/16240858444_1a3f8e5341_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Don’t get me started on their garlic-cilantro fries. Frita Batidos has some of the simplest yet most amazing fries I’ve had.
