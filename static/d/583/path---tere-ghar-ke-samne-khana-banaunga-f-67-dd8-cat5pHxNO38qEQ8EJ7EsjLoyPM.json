It's basically every recipe she made for me growing up that I have random cravings for since I've moved out to California.)</p>\n<p>Sometimes I feel like I'm not a complete adult yet. Even though I'm currently supporting myself, paying my own bills, taxes, and insurance, I don't always feel like a &quot;real&quot; adult. Then, there are times when suddenly I feel like a full on housewife, which is something I NEVER EVER want to be.</p>\n<p>One such instance was this past weekend, when I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of my new electric pressure cooker. One thing I'm <em>sure</em> every child growing up in an Indian household can relate to, is the sound of a pressure cooker. That sound TERRIFIED me to my core throughout my childhood, and to this day. I always feel like something somewhere is going to explode. Even in college when my roommate decided to make dal and turned on the pressure cooker, we used to hide behind our bedroom doors waiting for it to go off enough times so could turn it off and continue hiding. You'd think that it wouldn't be worth the fear, but honestly have you ever had dal or even better, Bangalore-style saaru? Yea, it's worth it. (If you're wondering what that is, it's a less liquidy and better version of rasam with more dal in it). I've tried all sorts of cooking techniques, but saaru just doesn't taste quite the same unless you use a pressure cooker. And this way, you don't end up wasting hours and hours making your meal. THAT is not worth it.</p>\n<p>The sound of our pressure cooker is even worse for our dog because he can hear the noise WAY before we can. He panics and runs all the way up the stairs and cowers near my parent's bedroom door. This happens without fail every time my mom STARTS the pressure cooker. He knows it's coming and refuses to come down from his hiding spot until he's completely sure it's not going to go off again. Poor baby. But I'm sure you'll all realize why once you get your own pressure cookers!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/btjgsul6c32hvenzfsw74q4e2xc34mi3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>But AHA! What is this?! An ELECTRIC pressure cooker? What is this magical device? So quiet and effective? Truly this can't be real! But miraculously, IT IS!</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51jpKXz6EuL._AC_UL320_SR308,320_.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I've never been so excited for any adult purchase in my life, except <em>maybe</em> my car. This was a glorious purchase. NOT ONLY can it make dal in 4 minutes, but I can use it to make dahi (yogurt or curds generally eaten with indian food), rice, and basically anything else in life I could ever think of! ALL WITHOUT MAKING A SOUND! I didn't even realize it had even started and it made a beeping noise indicating that my food was READY! It's wonderful.</p>\n<p>Amidst all this excitement over the pressure cooker, I got kind of homesick for my mom's food. I then proceeded to facetime my mom for an hour while she carefully explained step by step instructions on how to make one of my favorite childhood dishes, Bendekai Huli or for you non-Kannada speaking people out there, Okra Sambar. Most kids hate okra, but honestly it's one of my favorite vegetables, especially when it's in Indian food.</p>\n<p>I know this might not be the most flattering picture of any of us (mainly my brother) but whatever.</p>\n<p>One thing I will mention is that I am not sure where to get the huli pudi (sambar powder). My parents usually bring bags back from this little store in Bangalore every time anyone visits, but I'm sure you can find something similar in local Indian stores. I mean, I know I couldn't live without sambar so I'm sure there are other people who feel the same way and have found a way!

I always loved visiting my family there, and going for eight months was one of the most valuable times in my life. I loved every minute of it.</p>\n<p>This is a post about a breakfast place in Bangalore, Karnataka, India that everyone goes to. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/2xh4t94tv5kvay59fg04rz4uoczsmdsi.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Every city has this restaurant. It's not classically pretty, and there's no one waiting at the door to see whether or not you want to come in. This is a place where you have to leave your diet at the door (no one has any idea how many calories/protein grams/vats of butter are in your food anyway). The waiters are inattentive enough that a newcomer would have left on the spot, and there are literally never enough seats. There are a few places like this in Bangalore (in a city this big, with this much traffic, you need multiple choice breakfast spots), but Vidhyarthi Bhavan is arguably one of the most delicious.</p>\n<p>It's packed to the brim every day; I went on a Monday morning, and we had to stand behind people to snake their seats. And after we ate, people were standing behind us to snake ours. The restaurant is famous for it's Masala Dosa, although there are a couple of other items on the menu if you're interested.</p>\n<p>While you wait for your order, there are gorgeous photos of Mount Kailash, and really interesting pencil sketches of famous poets and writers of India adorning the walls.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/7opvixkr40x5e2k575lrbpy8rqnqnf1f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There's plenty of fodder for people watching, if the smells wafting from the kitchen aren't enough to keep you totally occupied. Finally, your order comes out.</p>\n<p>The dosas come to you on plates piled high in the waiter's arms (you have a brief moment where you are concerned that the bottom of someone else's plate has been all over your food); the waiter never actually looks at you before he heads to the next table. Then a second waiter, arguably less attentive than the first, comes over with a tureen of coconut, cilantro, and mint chutney and pours it onto your plate.</p>\n<p>You dig in with your fingers, barely resisting the urge to just dig in with your whole face. Finishing one of these babies is a task and a half, but you are definitely up to the challenge; going, going...gone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/by56r0iw8pjezazv9tvz46spa9zyx530.jpg\" alt=\"yummy yummy masale dosa!\"></p>\n<p>Finally, you get a cup of some excellent filter coffee to finish you right off, before you stumble into the daylight, and onto a street lined with flower and fruit merchants.</p>\n<p>You amble along, sniffing deeply and enjoying the almost-too-full-but-not-quite feeling in your stomach, and all feels right with the world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/7orlyigfozthf1tuoxjuo4cmt4etxsxh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","title":"Vidhyarthi Bhavan","slug":"vidhyarthi-bhavan","published_at":"01 February, 2016","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/by56r0iw8pjezazv9tvz46spa9zyx530.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c245","slug":"india"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ca","slug":"masala-dosa"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cb","slug":"indian-food"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cc","slug":"south-indian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cd","slug":"bangalore"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ce","slug":"vidhyarthi-bhavan"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2cf","slug":"nostalgia"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d0","slug":"homesick"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","slug":"anuchallenge2016"}]},"next":{"html":"<p>Welcome to another trip to India! When I was there, I ate a ton of food. All of my family members were happy to feed me, and between the amazing home cooking, and the delicious food available on every street corner, it's almost a miracle that I didn't pack on pounds.</p>\n<p>I am, generally, pretty picky about my food. I waver between being vegan and vegetarian, and I'm usually pretty careful about ingredients I allow in my kitchen. But, like everyone else, I have a fatal flaw and it's this; I love street food.</p>\n<p>I know that someone involved didn't wash their hands, I know that the ingredients aren't always top notch, I know that the fat, salt, and sugar content is probably WAY higher than anything I should be consuming. But I don't particularly care.</p>\n<p>In India a &quot;gaadi&quot; is a vehicle, and &quot;chaat&quot; is street food that has fresh vegetable, puffed rice, sweet and spicy sauces, and some fried components. So &quot;gaadi chaat&quot; is street food you get out of a flat bed cart.</p>\n<p>In Bangalore, there's a street people refer to as &quot;chaat street,&quot; and the street is lined with street food vendors. One end has a bakery, and the other end (the end I like to start on) has a few fruit carts, and one &quot;corn&quot; cart. I usually get my corn spiced with salt and chili, and mixed with raw, unripe mangoes (delicious!)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zw9hrme823kt4bmwzy4plu5w9jcwdkmz.jpg\" alt=\"imagine yummy food here, cuz you're missing it!\"></p>\n<p>Then it's time for Masala Chaat!
