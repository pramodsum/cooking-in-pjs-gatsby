Tis a day of celebration. Tis a day of learning. Tis a day that we call &quot;Pi Day.&quot; Tis also a day mostly famous amongst engineers, mathematicians, and physicists more than anyone else, but hey we're the awesome ones anyways ;)</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:7ha6LU5Dle7FGBh0I9LZIa\" width=\"auto\" max-width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>We had a pi(e) baking competition at work. Here's a look at some of the amazing creations that were submitted!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/nn8d2nka6ctmukq1xfdqmowwwailu5jq.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/rudqvq9eugx628537swax136zz26itbq.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>One of the best things about this competition was that began at exactly 1:59pm. It took me a LONG time until I realized that it was intended to begin at 3/14 1:59, which are the next few digits in pi.</p>\n<p>Once I got over how clutch that was, I began planning what I would bake to enter in this competition. There were tons of categories including best newbie, most creative, best savory, best sweet, etc. I decided I would do something different and make a savory pie, but what to make... THEN I realized I could make Indian savory pies (cover my dinner for a few days) and attempt to blow everyone's minds. I decided to enter 2 pies: a paneer tikka pie and a samosa pie. Yes, I am very well aware that a samosa pie is really just a LARGE samosa, it's just semantics. I have also realized I have watched too much Psych when I use the phrase &quot;it's just semantics&quot; excessively.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://gif.co/rqOE.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Since I decided to experiment so much you guys get TWO recipes this week all wrapped up inside one post. I know we're terrible people who haven't posted in a bit, but I promise we'll make it up to you guys and more. Since I used frozen pie crust, the overall time I spent baking was actually not as long as I had anticipated. I'm not going to write out the whole pie recipe because its fairly generic and you can follow the timings/instructions on the pie crust box itself. I made double crusted pies (where theres crust below and on top of the filling) so I just followed the instructions on the top pie crust box. It was something like this <a href=\"http://www.pillsbury.com/products/pie-crust/refrigerated-pie-crust\">crust</a>, the kind you roll out and lay on top of the pie.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/exwct8krjwx28uvx3j7ksk7g91ey4yp5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There's actually some chicken tikka mini pies in that picture above but that was mainly for myself ;)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/to0z9d01k9mh9k6oawuos5lkkm3ftzrw.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Paneer Tikka Pi(e) Filling</h2>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\">\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Uncooked paneer, cubed</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">4 tbsp tandoori masala powder (I really like Kissan Tandoori Masala)</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Dahi (curds)</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>Mix the tandoori masala and 2-3 large spoons of dahi  together in a large bowl.
