Usually that ends up being some simple pasta, vegetable fajitas, or toppings on a veggie burger. This time, I figured, why not try something different and make a veggie patty using these vegetables!</p>\n<p>It ended up being some kind of frittata/omelets/burger patty thing. While I may not be entirely sure what to call it, it tasted wonderful. And to my delight, it photographed really well! I actually ate the patty by itself but you could definitely eat these inside a burger or chopped up in a salad. So many options!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8577/16636556891_1f78750ce7_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8670/16018075843_3491552743_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <span class=\"item\">\n      <h2 class=\"fn\">Quinoa Veggie Patty</h2>\n    </span>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Recipe inspired by  http://www.halfbakedharvest.com/epic-crispy-quinoa-burgers-topped-sweet-potato-fries-beer-caramelized-onions-gruyere/</em></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup cooked red quinoa</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 cup chopped mushroom</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup sliced zucchini</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/2 cup sliced squash</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1/4 cup sliced red onion</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 egg</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 handful baby spinach</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">1 tsp red pepper flakes or dash of cayenne</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">salt and pepper to taste</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">lime slices for garnishing</li>\n      <li class=\"ingredient\">chopped green onion for garnishing</li>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        Mix all ingredients together and roll into medium-sized balls.

I've been taking some time off between graduation and when I start work next month. So when one of my friends was also bored at home during her spring break, she decided to come over and join me in being a bum for a day. And what better food to have while lazing around then some Mexican loaded fries.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8616/16520615948_6bcba795e9_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Feel free to use sour cream instead of ranch or even add guacamole and other toppings you usually put on nachos! We didn't really want to leave the house and go grocery shopping, so we went with whatever was in the fridge. I usually make my own mexican seasoning, but feel free to replace the spices with a store bought seasoning if you want.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8585/16708189875_07f14b40ee_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2>Mexican Loaded Fries</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>This is a very rough recipe.

It is a small cuban street food restaurant in downtown Ann Arbor. While it may be a slight walk from the University of Michigan campus, many students make the trek despite any ridiculous weather conditions to get a bite of these burgers.</p>\n<p>They have the one of the most delicious, insanely huge and jam packed burgers I’ve ever eaten in my life. No matter the patty you want inside your burger, whether it be black bean, chicken, or chorizo, you’re bound to get a tasty concoction which will blow your mind. Honestly I have yet to meet a person at the University of Michigan who doesn’t like their burgers.</p>\n<p>The basic burger (or Frita) is simple, just the patty between two egg buns and stuffed with fries. I also added some cilantro-lime salsa and tropical slaw to juice it up a little. Safe to say, I don’t think I would be trying to impress anyone while eating this monstrosity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7598/16243253993_f6b6d7018a_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>My brother always goes with a sunny side up egg and avocado spread on his frita. As soon as you bite into the burger, the yolk bursts, spreading that wonderful flavor into every bite thereafter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8679/16837349936_c34c5ef899_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This trip to Frita Batidos was special because we brought one of my friends here for her first time. She decided to go big or go home and made her frita “loco.” This means that they just go “loco” and add ALL of their available toppings on top of your burger: muenster, a sunny side up egg, cilantro lime salsa, tropical slaw, AND avocado spread! This is pretty much the mother of all burgers. I mean its GINORMOUS. My friend wasn’t even able to attempt to eat this with her hands. But oh was it delicious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8669/16240858444_1a3f8e5341_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Don’t get me started on their garlic-cilantro fries. Frita Batidos has some of the simplest yet most amazing fries I’ve had.  I can’t even describe them, you have to try them yourself!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7588/16863220175_acd3bd5a0b_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If you are ever in Ann Arbor <strong>MAKE SURE</strong> you head to downtown to taste one of these monstrosities, these glorious monstrosities of Frita Batidos.</p>\n<p>Check them <a href=\"http://www.fritabatidos.com\">out</a>!</p>\n","title":"The Glorious Monstrosities of Frita Batidos","slug":"frita-batidos","published_at":"27 March, 2015","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8669/16240858444_1a3f8e5341_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c233","slug":"fries"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c246","slug":"carnivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c263","slug":"frita-batidos"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c264","slug":"burgers"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c265","slug":"cuban"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c266","slug":"garlic"}]}}}
