Anytime anyone sees their local Girl Scouts at the grocery\nstore, they start drooling and daydreaming of Thin Mints, Tagalongs, Samoa's,\nand Do-si-Dos. Girl Scout cookies are some of my favorite type of cookies in the\nworld. While I may mainly be a fan of the plain shortbread cookies, Trefoils.\nThin mints and Samoa's are America's two favorites.\n\nWhile plunging into the depths of Pinterest one day, I found a recipe for mini\nsamoa donuts. That got me thinking... What if I were to make mini girl scout\nthemed cupcakes. And to make them even better, give them a slight \"adult\" twist.\n\n\n\nNot to toot my own horn, but these donut bites were AMAZING. Although they were \nreally  donuts... but rather cupcakes. They still tasted great. There was\ndefinitely not enough alcohol in any of the desserts to do any damage but the\nslight bourbon taste in the caramel brought out some awesome flavors.\n\nMy cousins and I even had a hard time not finishing up the caramel bourbon sauce\nbefore the donuts were ready. We kept eating spoon by spoon of the creamy\nbooze-ness.\n\nPro Tip:  Drizzle some warm caramel bourbon sauce onto a scoop of ice cream...\nHEAVEN.\n\nWhen I took these desserts to work, they were gone within minutes. Clearly\neveryone else was dying to get their Girl Scout cookie fix like I was. I even\nsaw this guy spooning caramel bourbon sauce into his coffee to make it a little\nmore \"Irish.\" ;)\n\nHere are the recipes for the donut bites. Even if you don't make the bites\nthemselves... you DEFINITELY have to try the Caramel Bourbon sauce. It takes a\nfew minutes to make and is EXTREMELY rewarding.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamoa Donut Bites\nIngredients:\nDonuts:\n1¼ cup all-purpose flour\n ½ tsp salt\n 1¼ tsp baking powder\n 1 tsp vanilla extract\n 1 egg\n ½ cup milk\n ½ tbsp lemon juice\n 2 tbsp butter, melted\n 4 tbsp Southern Comfort Caramel\n Caramel Bourbon Sauce\n1 package melting caramel (about 14 oz)\n 3 tbsp milk\n ¼ tsp salt\n 2 tbsp Souther Comfort Caramel  <h4>Toppings</h4>\n  <li class=\"ingredient\">3 cups unsweetened coconut flakes, toasted</li>\n</div>\n<div class=\"right\">\n  <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n  <div class=\"instructions\">\n    <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Cronut Fever. A\nchef in New York City decided that he would take croissant dough and fry it like\na donut. This scrumptious flaky dessert became SO  popular that there was even a\nblack market for them! People would pay $100 on the black market for a cronut\nthat could be bought for $5 if they waited in line for a day.\n\nI'd never tasted a cronut before in my life, so I decided to make use of a bunch\nof stale croissants I had lying around after a road trip. I tore the croissants\ninto bite size pieces and fried them in hot oil and count to 4. Quickly flip\neach cronut and fry again for 4 counts. Make sure not to cook them for too long\nor they get a little too crunchy and burn.\n\n\n\nPlace the fried bites onto paper towels to drain any excess oil. When cooled,\ndrizzle with any icing of your choice or enjoy them by themselves!\n\nThey were flaky yet crunchy, salty yet buttery. It was amazing! I completely\nunderstand what the fuss was in New York City at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, I learned a few things while making these. Making them with\nstore-bought croissants is fine, however you get the proper ratio of flakiness\nto fried crunchiness when you use croissant dough. It is also easier not to burn\nthem while frying when you use dough. I am not a huge fan of too much oil, so\nfrying the croissants wasn't my favorite. Maybe there's a way to shallow fry\nthem where they won't pick up too much oil, but I have no idea. Next time I try\nmaking cronut bites, I will try to bake store-bought croissants and see if that\nmakes a difference. Who knows!\n\nFor the mean time, I completely suggest you try making these at home! They're\nsimple to make and taste amazing! If you're too lazy then I'd recommend going to\nyour local pastry shop and seeing if they make something similar!","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I3bLdLcbLHBZH2QIeDqAX55etYu-5I1Tz94-7LJ62KRW=s800","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23d","name":"brunch","slug":"brunch"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23f","name":"breakfast","slug":"breakfast"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c27d","name":"donuts","slug":"donuts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c283","name":"cronut","slug":"cronut"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c284","name":"fried","slug":"fried"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c285","name":"croissant","slug":"croissant"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"donuts","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
