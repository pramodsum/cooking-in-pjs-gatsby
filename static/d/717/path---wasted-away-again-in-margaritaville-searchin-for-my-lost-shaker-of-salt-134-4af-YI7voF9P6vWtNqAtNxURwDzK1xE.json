Jimmy Buffett actually had a cameo in Jurassic World last year. Of course he was one of the people escaping the pterodactyls. But of course, in true Margaritaville fashion, he makes sure to grab BOTH of his margaritas before making a run for it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rHfvEne.gif?noredirect\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This man is a hero. He clearly knows what today is about. If you haven't already, definitely play the song I linked to above while reading the post. I promise the lyrics won't disappoint. If you're really digging the song, I totally recommend checking out the entire album. It's a gold mine of amazing songs like &quot;Cheeseburger in Paradise&quot;, &quot;Pencil Thin Mustache&quot;, &quot;Grapefruit - Juicy Fruit&quot;, &quot;Son of a Son of a Sailor&quot;, and last but not least &quot;Why Don't We Get Drunk.&quot; I've linked the entire album here for your enjoyment. Do it. I promise it's totally worth it.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:6MlglzxBetAjx7yZNAQt3D\" width=\"auto\" max-width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe>\n<p>Using the great Jimmy Buffett and National Margarita Day as inspiration, I figured I can FINALLY share the amazing strawberry margaritas with you guys. I made these margaritas last year for a Cinco de Mayo celebration at my cousin's place. Technically it was Seis de Mayo because May 5th last year was a Tuesday and everyone was busy that day. These were a HUGE hit and best part is that when you run out of strawberries you can just use more lime juice and make plain margaritas. It's the best.</p>\n<p>In case you needed more convincing to actually listen to that song:</p>\n<p><em>&quot;But there's booze in the blender, and soon it will render that frozen concoction that helps me hang on.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Yeah... I know. He sings from the heart. Now turn on the song and start blending up some delicious margaritas for you and your friends!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/3vs3q24ymcfuxdqkfsiuu3m7y0k1itr7.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Frozen Strawberry Margaritas</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Just as a warning, these are quite strong so I'd recommend tasting as you add the tequila.

First things first, put your ice cream maker's bowl in the freezer, and chill your coconut milk in the fridge overnight before you start. \n</p><p>\n2.) Put your strawberries, blueberries, juice, and maple syrup into a saucepan and let simmer. When the fruit is about halfway to being complete mush, move to step 3. \n</p><p>\n3.) Crack open your coconut milk and pour into the blender. Add the maple syrup, and carefully remove some of the juice that's in your saucepan, and add it as well. This cuts down on simmering time for the jam, and adds color and flavor to the ice cream! Blend. \n</p><p> \n4.) While the fruit continues to cook, take about 3/4 of the coconut milk you've blended up and put it in a container. Then add the arrowroot or cornstarch, and blend the remaining 1/4 until fully combined. Pour into container with the rest of the coconut milk base. \n</p><p> \n5.) Your fruit should be complete mush now - if there's any juice left, now is the time to slowly pour it into the ice cream base, until there's only a couple of tablespoons of liquid in the saucepan with the fruit. \n</p><p>\n6.) Carefully sprinkle the arrowroot or cornstarch onto the fruit, stirring vigorously to prevent clumping. Allow to cook an additional couple of minutes, until the mixture has thickened just a bit. Remove from heat, and pour into a container. \n</p><p>\n7.) Put the coconut milk base and jam into the fridge - both need to chill for a bit, at least twelve hours, ideally 24 or more. \n</p><p>\n8.) Climb a tree, read a book, explore nature. Go to work? You do you, boo boo. \n</p><p>\n9.) When all ingredients are thoroughly chilled, follow the directions on your ice cream maker! When there are five - ten minutes left, add the jam, and allow to incorporate completely. \n</p><p>\n10.) Eat ice cream in February. Don't let THE MAN tell you what to do. \n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>","title":"Itâ€™s Summertime Somewhere - Coconut Berry Ice Cream","slug":"coconut-berry-ice-cream","published_at":"22 February, 2016","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/gcws27i9ca8jn5gkqd2j6osakirvt43d.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2df","slug":"ice-cream"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e0","slug":"coconut-milk"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e1","slug":"berries"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e2","slug":"summertime"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e3","slug":"sweet-treats"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e4","slug":"fight-the-power"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e5","slug":"i-stand-with-planned-parenthood"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e6","slug":"and-black-lives-matter"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e7","slug":"and-native-nations"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2e8","slug":"power-to-the-people"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","slug":"desserts"}]},"next":{"html":"<p>Spring break baby!

We parked, and it was about a mile walk to the beach. The entire area was insanely picturesque, and I was half convinced that we had stepped out of San Francisco and into a Lord of the Rings movie.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/x2uo0tras4nbnknlrtbrmqs3jrq69hz0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>From there, we went to get brunch, before heading to Valencia St. to look at street art, before heading to Dolores Park. On the way, we passed the The Women's Building, which has one of the coolest murals I've ever seen on it - if you find yourself in SF, definitely head over there. It's a celebration of women, and it's totally gorgeous.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ov0xg36h85u5eqaz30mfp3ilsw60dxeq.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>After that, we went to Dolores Park and visited the Golden Gate Bridge at sunset!</p>\n<p>Today, we woke up bright and early and headed to Capitola and Natural Bridges State Beach.

Research indicates that Cocota is a neighborhood in Brasil, although I can't speak to the authenticity of the sauce. Either way, it was pretty good; the sauce is quite strong, and while I thought it was delicious, it was a bit much for brunch.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/z6r4ajucixwzwnh3bv2t9bxe5auaf6rg.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Either way, definitely worth a visit.
