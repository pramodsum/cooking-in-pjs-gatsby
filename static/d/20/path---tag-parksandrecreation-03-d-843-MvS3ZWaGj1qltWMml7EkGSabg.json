So, this post, I'm\ntaking a page out of her book, and writing a love letter to Sumu, my co-writer,\nsoul sister, and fellow adventurer.\n\nSpecial shout-out to the lady who taught me how to be a friend; my mom. My mom\nis intelligent, beautiful, and determined. But above all, she's caring and real.\nShe has a loving and compassionate heart, and seeing her with her friends is\nsomething I will always cherish. I am so glad that we've grown into a\nfriendship. I'm the lame kid whose mom is her best friend. And I am really\nreally really lucky.\n\n\n\nDear Sumedha,\n\nThanks for being amazing. For coming to the rescue every time my pictures are\nsideways, or I can't figure out my own cellphone. For bringing Mindy's and\nAziz's books home because you knew I was dying to read them, making me a\nscrapbook so I wouldn't have to make my own, and putting together an otter\nwatching road trip itinerary, so that I could go on a stress free but totally\nplanned ride.\n\nThanks for putting up with me when I get temporarily obsessed with boy bands.\nThanks for laughing at me when I snap back to my senses. With your love, nobody\ncan drag me down.\n\nThanks for being brown with me. And watching Meet the Patels with me over the\nphone. This is what dreams are made of.\n\n\n\nThanks for always reassuring me about my admittedly glorious self, and being\nhonest but kind when I look bad in something. Thanks for encouraging my dreams,\nand constantly believing in me. You are the person I send selfies to when I feel\ngood about myself, and I love that about our relationship.\n\nYou're incandescent, smart, lovely, talented, kind, caring, and authentic. You\nare an incredible friend, which is perhaps one of the best things I could say\nabout a person. I am so lucky to have you in my life.\n\n\n\nThanks for being my otter watching and blog partner. Thanks for being the Joey\nto my Chandler, the Ann to my Knope, and the Tina to my Amy.\n\n\n\nAlso, thanks for being the first of the two of us to not post on her day. It\nreally took the pressure off of me (I think we BOTH thought it would be me!), so\nthanks. I love you, man.\n\nIn honor of our friendship, Friends, and Valentines Day itself, I made scones. I\nhope you like them.\n\n\n\n<3 Anu\n\nApricot - Pistachio Scones\nThese scones are part whole wheat, part all purpose flour, and I think they\nwould benefit from the addition of a floral note. If it's available to you, I\nwould try adding orange blossom water or rose water, and experimenting a bit.\nAlso, the Xanthan gum is optional. If you do use it, I used Bob's Red Mill. I've\nnever used it before, and I found it to be really helpful in keeping the dough\ntogether, but a lot of recipes I read didn't use it, and the recipe authors in\nthose cases were fine. \n![](https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zrfxkw1s664clf43v12y5lmefqryahzc.jpg)\n\n\n\nYield: 12 scones\n\nTotal Time:  1 hour\n\nIngredients:\nScones\n1 1/4 C All Purpose Flour\n 3/4 C Whole Wheat Flour\n 1/2 Tsp Cardamom\n 1 1/2 Tsp Cinnamon3 Tbsp Sugar 2 Tsp Baking Powder1 Tsp Salt1/3 C Pistachios1/2\nC Dry Apricots3/4 C Cashews1 Tbsp Xanthan GumMaple Syrop (for brushing the tops)  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"right\">\n  <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n  <div class=\"instructions\">\n    <p>\n    1.) Preheat the oven to 375 F, and oil/grease a cookie sheet. Put Cashews and Xanthan Gum in a bowl, and add boiling water to submerge cashews. You want to let the cashews hydrate a bit while you're mixing up other stuff.\n\n\n\n2.) Chop your apricots into bits - 1/4 - 1/2 inch in size, and put them in a\nbowl. Add boiling water to those too - re-hydrating them keeps them juicy during\nthe baking process.\n\n\n3.) Mix your flours, salt, baking powder, sugar, cardamom, and cinnamon. Make\nsure all ingredients are fully mixed in.\n\n\n4.) Roughly chop your pistachios, and throw them into the flour. Give it a quick\ntoss to make sure your pistachios are even incorporated.\n\n\n5.) Drain the apricot water into the bowl with cashews and Xanthan gum. Throw\nthe cashews, gum, and some water into the blender. You want it to be the\nconsistency of a thick greek yogurt, so add as much water as you need to get it\nthere, a little bit at a time.\n\n\n6.) Add your apricots to the flour and give it a quick toss, making sure the\napricots are even through the dough.\n\n\n7.) Add your cashew mixture a half cup at a time, until the dough is slightly\nsticky, and shaggy, but holds together. You don't want to over-knead. This is\nVERY IMPORTANT. DO NOT OVER-KNEAD.\n\n\n8.) Once your dough has just come together, dump it onto a floured surface, and\nfold it over twice - once top to bottom, flatten out, then from the other side.\nTHAT'S IT. LEAVE IT ALONE. It's done.\n\n\n9.) Form into a disk about 1 - 1/2 inch thick, and cut into whatever shape you\nwant. I went with the classic triangles, but it's up to you.\n\n\n10.) Brush the bottoms with a touch of flour, and the tops with maple syrup. Pop\ninto the oven, and bake for 15 - 20 minutes. I checked on them at 15, and\ndiscovered that they needed a bit more time to not be dense and dough-y.\n\n  \n11.) Eat piping hot! Slice them open, enjoy them with a bit of additional maple\nsyrup or a pat of butter, and a delicious cup of tea!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/zrfxkw1s664clf43v12y5lmefqryahzc.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d7","name":"scones","slug":"scones"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d8","name":"greatbritishbaking","slug":"greatbritishbaking"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2d9","name":"galentinesday","slug":"galentinesday"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2da","name":"valentinesday","slug":"valentinesday"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2db","name":"parksandrecreation","slug":"parksandrecreation"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2dc","name":"leslieknope","slug":"leslieknope"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2dd","name":"leslieandann","slug":"leslieandann"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2de","name":"amypoehler","slug":"amypoehler"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"parksandrecreation","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
