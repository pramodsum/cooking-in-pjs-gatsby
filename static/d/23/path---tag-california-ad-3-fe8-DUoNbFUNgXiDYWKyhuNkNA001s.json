As of Friday, I am SORT OF on spring break. While I have an\nassignment due tomorrow that I am still working on, I've been in California\nvisiting Sumu since Friday!\n\nWhile I've buckled down a bit today, Sumu and I spent all of yesterday and this\nmorning running around San Francisco and nearby beaches.\n\nThe soundtrack to our trip?\n\nWe started off our day at Land's End Recreation Area, which was hands down my\nfavorite part of the trip so far. We parked, and it was about a mile walk to the\nbeach. The entire area was insanely picturesque, and I was half convinced that\nwe had stepped out of San Francisco and into a Lord of the Rings movie.\n\n\n\nFrom there, we went to get brunch, before heading to Valencia St. to look at\nstreet art, before heading to Dolores Park. On the way, we passed the The\nWomen's Building, which has one of the coolest murals I've ever seen on it - if\nyou find yourself in SF, definitely head over there. It's a celebration of\nwomen, and it's totally gorgeous.\n\n\n\nAfter that, we went to Dolores Park and visited the Golden Gate Bridge at\nsunset!\n\nToday, we woke up bright and early and headed to Capitola and Natural Bridges\nState Beach. We wandered around the beach for a while before getting ourselves\nto our favorite meal: brunch.\n\n\n\nThis place was pretty small, but really cute, and had excellent brunch options.\nI ordered Gallo Pinto, which was described on the menu as a Costa Rican dish.\n\n\n\nI liked my dish a lot; the plantains, rice, egg, and sauce went really well\ntogether, and I found myself clearing my plate!\n\nSumu got the Veggie Cocota, with was veggies and poached eggs covered in a\nCocota sauce. Research indicates that Cocota is a neighborhood in Brasil,\nalthough I can't speak to the authenticity of the sauce. Either way, it was\npretty good; the sauce is quite strong, and while I thought it was delicious, it\nwas a bit much for brunch.\n\n\n\nEither way, definitely worth a visit. If you're in Santa Cruz, definitely head\nover; they also have fresh juice that's perfect for taking with you to the\nbeach!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/hinrb93xbood40avb37ozvuldf5qqbtg.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c26c","name":"california","slug":"california"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f1","name":"besties","slug":"besties"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f2","name":"visits","slug":"visits"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f3","name":"spring break","slug":"spring-break"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f4","name":"santa cruz","slug":"santa-cruz"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f5","name":"san francisco","slug":"san-francisco"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f6","name":"land's end","slug":"lands-end"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f8","name":"natural bridges","slug":"natural-bridges"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f7","name":"the shire","slug":"the-shire"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f9","name":"golden gate","slug":"golden-gate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fa","name":"the women's center","slug":"the-womens-center"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fb","name":"cafe brasil","slug":"cafe-brasil"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c350","uuid":"0471ace4-44cc-4677-a447-dd097e15cbcb","title":"Dirty Dancing: Salsa Nights","slug":"dirty-dancing-salsa-nights","published_at":"01 May, 2015","plaintext":"First of all, Dirty Dancing Havana Nights is one of my favorite movies. The\nmusic, the dancing, and let's not forget Diego Luna. In honor of Diego Luna and\nhis amazing dancing, play the song below while you read this post. Now that\nyou've set the mood, let's get started.\n\nHaving lived in Michigan most of my life, I've been used to eating sub par\nMexican food and grew to love that. However last month when me and my family\nwent to Cancun for a week, I knew I had been missing out on something big. The\namazing flavors of corn tortillas, super flavorful meat (or beans for you\nvegetarians), fresh salsas and Crema Mexicana mesh together for a completely\ndifferent experience of eating simple tacos. Now that I had officially been\nconverted to a taco snob, I was determined to only eat the best of tacos I could\nfind.\n\nConveniently the bay area is filled with the most amazing food, especially when\nit comes to taco trucks. Each taco truck I've visited usually has a side of a\nfew salsas. I was determined to recreate two of my favorite taco truck salsas,\nan avocado tomatillo salsa and a spicy red chili salsa, as authentic as\npossible.\n\n\n\nI found a few recipes online, and experimented on my own and finally ended up\nwith these recipes!\n\n\n\nAvocado Tomatillo Salsa\nFeel free to adjust the number of chilis based on your own spice tolerance. You\ncan also remove the seeds of the chilis to reduce their spice as well. Also keep\nin mind that this salsa tends to be the milder balance to the other super spicy\nred salsa.\n\nIngredients:\n4-5 tomatillos, husked, rinsed, and chopped\n 4-5 serrano chilies\n 1 cup packed cilantro, chopped\n ½ white onion minced\n ¼ cup water\n 1 ripe Hass Avocado\n Lime juice to taste\n Salt and pepper to taste\n Directions:\nBlend all ingredients together in your blender until smooth.\n\n\n\nRed Chili Tomatillo Salsa\nAgain, feel free to adjust the number of chilis based on your own spice\ntolerance. You can also remove the seeds of the chilis to reduce their spice as\nwell. I made mine super spicy and had no complaints so I say go for it!\n\nIngredients:\n5-6 tomatillos, husked, rinsed, and chopped\n 1-2 roma tomatoes chopped\n 6 cloves of garlic\n ½ white onion minced\n 6-7 hot dried red chilies, stemmed\n ½ tsp sugar\n Salt and pepper to taste\n Directions:\nDry roast the chilies and garlic until you can really smell them and they both\nhave darkened a bit. Blend these along with the rest of the ingredients together\nin your blender until smooth.\n\nMake sure to check out my post coming out soon about food truck style tacos I\nmade!","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8743/17335026415_ff5458c370_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c243","name":"mexican","slug":"mexican"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c25e","name":"salsa","slug":"salsa"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c26a","name":"spicy","slug":"spicy"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c26c","name":"california","slug":"california"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c26e","name":"tomatillo","slug":"tomatillo"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c26f","name":"avocado","slug":"avocado"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c270","name":"chilies","slug":"chilies"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c271","name":"taco truck","slug":"taco-truck"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"california","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
