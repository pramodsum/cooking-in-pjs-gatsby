I made my first\nsolo move as an adult. I packed up my apartment in Sunnyvale and finally  moved\nto San Francisco. If you're wondering why I picked this specific Van Morrison\nsong, I felt like it was meant to be. The song Saint Dominic's Preview has a lot\nof references to the Saint Dominic's Church on the intersection of Bush and\nSteiner in San Francisco, literally a block from my new apartment. Everyday when\nI walk back from the bus stop after work, I pass by this gorgeous church and\nadmire it. It just felt right to pick this song for the post. :)\n\nHowever, if that song isn't your speed and you want something a little more\nsultry, try this one by Carmen McRae.\n\nI've had a blast since moving out here. I get to see my friends almost every\nday. I have a wonderful new roommate who I've known since college. Even after\nonly a week, I've got to attend all sorts of weird and yet awesome things! This\nwas an art exhibit that was installed right outside City Hall over this past\nweek.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd best of all, I get to cook with my friends, both old and new! I went over to\na friend's place yesterday night and me and a new friend, Kerry, began to make\nsome DELICIOUS fresh spring rolls. Granted, the recipe for this has been posted\non this site before, the food could never have been more delicious and\ndifferent. We filled these with lettuce, shrimp, vermicelli noodles, and more!\nWe even made some peanut sauce to dip the rolls in (just mix some hoisin sauce\nand creamy peanut butter together). Simple, yet delicious!\n\nWe did have some mishaps during the process. San Francisco kitchens are usually\nTINY, as are a lot of the apartments. My friend's kitchen is very much sizable\nfor 1 person cooking. When you try to squeeze 4 people in there, chaos ensues.\n\n 1. We were lied to about the presence of peanut butter, hence sending the boys\n    on one trip to the store\n 2. Kerry and I weren't aware that the pasta strainer LOCKED onto the pot we\n    were cooking the noodles in. This unfortunately caused ALL of the noodles to\n    fall into the sink, hence a second trip to the store to get more noodles\n 3. The boys may never let us live this down. Highly unlikely after all the sass\n    given while Kerry and I made their dinner.\n 4. They showed me this amazing group that performs acoustic covers of popular\n    songs [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y7Vq9749s8]... MIND BLOWING. I'm not\n    gonna lie I may have teared up a bit.\n\nWhile I may not have an explicit recipe for you, I have plenty of photos and\nfull stomachs as proof.

I'm also waiting for the day when I\ncan try this recipe for Chickpea Flour Pizza Crust\n[http://www.loveandlemons.com/chickpea-flour-pizza-asparagus/?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds] \n because YUM.\n\n2.) Minimalist Baker hits it out of the park every time. They have a real talent\nfor finding fresh, simple recipes with easy (and short!) cleanup! Check out\ntheir recipe for Gingery Thai Kale Salad with Cashew Dressing\n[http://minimalistbaker.com/gingery-thai-kale-salad-cashew-dressing/]\n\n3.) I love Annie's Eats, especially her cocktail posts! Now that summer's\ncoming, it's time to turn out minds to summertime cocktails, and there's\nsomething about this Gin, Grapefruit, and Rosemary Cocktail\n[http://www.annies-eats.com/2016/03/25/gin-grapefruit-and-rosemary-cocktail/] \nthat feels delightfully spring-y.\n\n4.) Smitten Kitten is incredibly prolific; they do an amazing job of posting\nsuper frequently with high quality recipes! Here's one of there's that I'm\npretty sure is an Italian sort of Shakshouka Eggs in Purgatory, Puttanesca-Style\n[http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2016/03/eggs-in-purgatory-puttanesca-style/].\n\n5.) The Beeroness is one of my favorite people on the internet. All of her\nrecipes are accompanied by great stories about her life, and the food itself is\nnothing to sneeze at. If you're a beer lover OR a food lover, you'll love her\nblog; right now, I really want to try her Grilled Garlic-Beer Flatbread\n[http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2016/03/eggs-in-purgatory-puttanesca-style/].\n\nEnjoy the recipes, and if you get a chance to try them before I do (super\nlikely) let me know how it goes!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/75ycreg8gpwyyvfdmpmdtiomxiop1sg4.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c26b","name":"food truck","slug":"food-truck"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c242","name":"giggle juice","slug":"giggle-juice"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c314","name":"loving lately","slug":"loving-lately"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c315","name":"favorite blogs","slug":"favorite-blogs"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c316","name":"yum","slug":"yum"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c35f","uuid":"e0f988c3-12d8-419a-b327-025e484d0fd2","title":"When a moon hits your eye like a big pizza pi(e)","slug":"when-a-moon-hits-your-eye-like-a-big-pizza-pi","published_at":"07 April, 2016","plaintext":"March 14th is a very famous day. Tis a day of celebration. Tis a day of\nlearning. Tis a day that we call \"Pi Day.\" Tis also a day mostly famous amongst\nengineers, mathematicians, and physicists more than anyone else, but hey we're\nthe awesome ones anyways ;)\n\nWe had a pi(e) baking competition at work. Here's a look at some of the amazing\ncreations that were submitted!\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best things about this competition was that began at exactly 1:59pm.\nIt took me a LONG time until I realized that it was intended to begin at 3/14\n1:59, which are the next few digits in pi.\n\nOnce I got over how clutch that was, I began planning what I would bake to enter\nin this competition. There were tons of categories including best newbie, most\ncreative, best savory, best sweet, etc. I decided I would do something different\nand make a savory pie, but what to make... THEN I realized I could make Indian\nsavory pies (cover my dinner for a few days) and attempt to blow everyone's\nminds. I decided to enter 2 pies: a paneer tikka pie and a samosa pie. Yes, I am\nvery well aware that a samosa pie is really just a LARGE samosa, it's just\nsemantics. I have also realized I have watched too much Psych when I use the\nphrase \"it's just semantics\" excessively.\n\n\n\nSince I decided to experiment so much you guys get TWO recipes this week all\nwrapped up inside one post. I know we're terrible people who haven't posted in a\nbit, but I promise we'll make it up to you guys and more. Since I used frozen\npie crust, the overall time I spent baking was actually not as long as I had\nanticipated. I'm not going to write out the whole pie recipe because its fairly\ngeneric and you can follow the timings/instructions on the pie crust box itself.\nI made double crusted pies (where theres crust below and on top of the filling)\nso I just followed the instructions on the top pie crust box. It was something\nlike this crust\n[http://www.pillsbury.com/products/pie-crust/refrigerated-pie-crust], the kind\nyou roll out and lay on top of the pie.\n\n\n\nThere's actually some chicken tikka mini pies in that picture above but that was\nmainly for myself ;)\n\n\n\nPaneer Tikka Pi(e) Filling\nIngredients:\nUncooked paneer, cubed\n 4 tbsp tandoori masala powder (I really like Kissan Tandoori Masala)\n Dahi (curds)\n Directions:\nMix the tandoori masala and 2-3 large spoons of dahi together in a large bowl.\nAdd the paneer and mix until the paneer pieces are fully covered in the\nmarinade. Add more dahi and tandoori masala as needed. Let the paneer marinate\nfor at least 2 hours.\n\n\n\nSamosa Pi(e) Filling\nIngredients:\n3 medium sized potatoes\n 1 cup green peas\n 1 tsp ginger-garlic paste\n 1 tsp garam masala powder\n 1 tsp red chili powder\n 1 tsp dry mango powder\n 1 tsp coriander powder\n 3/4 tsp cumin seeds\n 2 tbsp chopped coriander\n 1 tsp garam masala powder\n lemon juice (to taste)\n salt (to taste)\n Directions:\nFill a pot 3/4 full with water and add the potatoes and a pinch of salt. Boil on\nmedium-high heat until potatoes are cooked completely. Put the potatoes in a\nbowl of cold water to cool for a minute. Peel and chop the potatoes into cubes.\n\nHeat a little oil in a pan. Add cumin and roast. When the cumin starts\ncrackling, add the ginger-garlic paste and sauté until the smell of raw ginger\ngoes away. Lower the heat and add all the dry spices and stir.\n\nAdd the potatoes and peas along with salt (to taste).

Sorry for the brief and awkward hiatus; it was certainly\nnot our intention, and won't be happening again! Sumu was moving, and I was\nletting law school rain on my parade. But we're back now!\n\n\n\nSumu's all settled into her new apartment in the city, and while law school is\nstill kicking my ass, I've decided to chill out. Law school itself was never the\npoint, and forgetting that is the number one cause of stress for me.\n\nSo, we're kicking off our triumphant return with a throwback recipe. When I got\nto California to visit Sumu, we made fresh rolls. I'll be honest and say that I\ndon't know the difference between a spring roll and a fresh roll. What I do know\nis that fresh rolls, full of bright, delicious veggies and sauces, feel like\nspring time to me.\n\n\n\nThis recipe is easily customizable, for which reason there are no specific\nquantities in the recipe. Do what your heart tells you. Go with your gut. Feel\nout your local grocer and figure out what you can get in what quantities.\n\nSpring is finally here, and while spring break has long since passed, these\nrolls will pretty much always be in season.\n\nSpring Rolls\nThese are the best way to deliver a quick, one two punch of veggies to yo' bod.\nYour mouth and your stomach deserve this meal.

Set a shallow plate full of hot water beside you, and take out a rice paper\nsheet. Dip it into the water for ten seconds, and then lay it out on a cutting\nboard.\n\n\n3.)

There are so many\ndifferent varieties of food I love making and it makes no sense for me to\nmaintain a kitchen stocked with ALL the ingredients for whenever I'd want to\nmake any of these things. Usually when I post recipes, I try to use the\ningredients I already have, can make substitutes, or keep the grocery shopping\nto a minimum. #LivinLaVidaLazy\n\nI didn't have some of the specific ingredients so I used a bunch of more\ncommonly available substitutes and tasted it every now and then if I needed to\nmake adjustments. My recipe is roughly based on a recipe from Gimme Some Oven\n[http://www.gimmesomeoven.com/homemade-bbq-sauce-recipe/]  & Food Renegade\n[http://www.foodrenegade.com/homemade-worcesterschire-sauce/]. However, doubt me\nas you will, I had my friend who's grown up in Texas taste test my sauce and he\nloved it. You don't mess with Texans and their BBQ sauce... they know their\nsauce. He did give me one suggestion that I'll pass along to you guys, which was\nto add Liquid Smoke. Personally I have no idea what that is, but apparently it\nis life changing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHomemade BBQ Sauce\nIngredients:\n1/4 cup molasses\n 1/4 cup mustard\n 1/2 cup red wine (or apple cider vinegar)\n 1 tsp paprika\n 1 tsp garlic powder\n 1 tsp freshly ground garlic\n salt to taste\n a few pinches of cayenne pepper to taste\n Tomato Sauce + Paste\n3 Roma tomatoes, pureed\n 1/4 cup ketchup (or puree 1 more tomato with some salt)\n \"Worcestershire\" Sauce\n1/2 cup red wine (or apple cider vinegar)\n 1 tbsp molasses\n 1 tbsp tamarind paste\n Juice of 1 lime\n 1/2 tsp ground clove\n 1/4 tsp garlic\n 1/4 tsp chili powder\n Directions:\nWhisk all the ingredients together in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a\nsimmer then reduce to medium-low. Allow the sauce to simmer uncovered until it\nhas thickened to the right consistency.\n\nUse the sauce immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 week.\n\nI used my sauce to make some delicious pulled chicken in my slow cooker. I used \nthis post from Family Fresh Meals\n[http://www.familyfreshmeals.com/2014/06/best-crockpot-bbq-chicken.html]  to\nfigure out how to actually cook the chicken and didn't bother adding the extra\nItalian dressing, Worcestershire Sauce, etc. Also in keeping with the\n#LivinLaVidaLazy theme, I didn't even bother buying buns for the chicken. I just\ndevoured it on various types of crackers I had at home. Best thing about this\nsauce is that you can use it in SO many different ways. Not only did I use it\nfor pulled chicken, but we coated some fried tofu with the sauce to take our\nfresh rolls to a whole new level.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/9rqxf3dpvx4qrfmuuqcosdfr6sjjv3v2.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fc","name":"bbq","slug":"bbq"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fd","name":"southern","slug":"southern"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c246","name":"carnivores","slug":"carnivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fe","name":"sauce","slug":"sauce"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2ff","name":"comfort","slug":"comfort"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c300","name":"country","slug":"country"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":6,"skip":12,"numPages":10,"currentPage":3}}
