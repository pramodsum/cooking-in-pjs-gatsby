Cronut Fever. A chef in New York City decided that he would take croissant dough and fry it like a donut. This scrumptious flaky dessert became <strong>SO</strong> popular that there was even a black market for them! People would pay $100 on the black market for a cronut that could be bought for $5 if they waited in line for a day.</p>\n<p>I'd never tasted a cronut before in my life, so I decided to make use of a bunch of stale croissants I had lying around after a road trip. I tore the croissants into bite size pieces and fried them in hot oil and count to 4. Quickly flip each cronut and fry again for 4 counts. Make sure not to cook them for too long or they get a little too crunchy and burn.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uItKVRYVHXTTy-8axm084k_HfxLO6xzEZdPLVsRCD4KB=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Place the fried bites onto paper towels to drain any excess oil. When cooled, drizzle with any icing of your choice or enjoy them by themselves!</p>\n<p>They were flaky yet crunchy, salty yet buttery. It was amazing! I completely understand what the fuss was in New York City at the time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t7G8JSAQTWhF4tYo7phZ4pW0JmJUR3wW9tfbTtKWJiYd=s800\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jSVFKsebGkxhYqNYuiNsVIhtieIrE3c0NZTu-IJJw5VK=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>However, I learned a few things while making these. Making them with store-bought croissants is fine, however you get the proper ratio of flakiness to fried crunchiness when you use croissant dough. It is also easier not to burn them while frying when you use dough. I am not a huge fan of too much oil, so frying the croissants wasn't my favorite. Maybe there's a way to shallow fry them where they won't pick up too much oil, but I have no idea. Next time I try making cronut bites, I will try to bake store-bought croissants and see if that makes a difference. Who knows!</p>\n<p>For the mean time, I completely suggest you try making these at home! They're simple to make and taste amazing! If you're too lazy then I'd recommend going to your local pastry shop and seeing if they make something similar!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_h3gaGiFbUHaUe_a9dnjOu6yMLoZv8oXEt19I2f1god5=w1976-h1316-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n","feature_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/I3bLdLcbLHBZH2QIeDqAX55etYu-5I1Tz94-7LJ62KRW=s800","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23d","name":"brunch","slug":"brunch"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23f","name":"breakfast","slug":"breakfast"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c27d","name":"donuts","slug":"donuts"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c283","name":"cronut","slug":"cronut"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c284","name":"fried","slug":"fried"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c285","name":"croissant","slug":"croissant"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c37a","uuid":"38072c55-2abc-41d8-8cd1-7c995002e516","title":"Little Bites of Heaven","url":"https://cookinginpjs.herokuapp.com/little-bites-of-heaven/","published_at":"05 May, 2015","html":"<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8772/17361867465_b5793fb7f7_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I LOVE baking but since I don't really like eating desserts its usually pretty hard to come up with reasons to actually make anything. I usually just end up making really small quantities which barely justifies all the ingredients I would have needed to get to make the desserts. At work I noticed that anytime someone brought in donuts or anything else, people would hunt the food down and devour it. Figuring this the was the best opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, so I whipped up a few batches of the brownies and brought them to work.</p>\n<p>First, I sent an email to my team and only a few people grabbed some. I thought I had made a complete mistake making so many brownies, or maybe I was delusional about how the brownies tasted since I had made them. As a last option, I sent an email out to the whole company and left them in the common area of my floor. Twenty minutes later when I went to go check on them, I saw an empty box. Clearly the brownies had been a huge hit! Now that I've found the perfect group to sample all of my treats, I can bake without worries! My coworkers can expect a flood of baked goods at least once a month from here on out while I use them as guinea pigs for all the different desserts I've always wanted to make! :)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7711/17154413587_86e925b5aa_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7766/16741602133_ec8f6f5fc7_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Personally, I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake, but these little bites are amazing. At first when I bit into one, it was perfectly gooey and chocolatey and with a little bit of cheesecake to top off the flavor. I honestly wasn't sure if I hadn't cooked them all the way, but after thoroughly inspecting and devouring a few, I realized that that's just the way the brownies cook! Each brownie was perfectly gooey yet filled with flavors just melting in your mouth. The cheesecake portion was the perfect compliment for the sweetness of the brownies.

No one could have answered that question better than Amy Poehler herself, &quot;it's only the best day of the year. Every February 13th, my lady friends and I leave our husbands and our boyfriends at home, and we just come and kick it, breakfast-style. Ladies celebrating ladies. It's like Lilith Fair, minus the angst. Plus frittatas.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ever year on Valentine's Day, my mom sends me a special gift. When I lived it at home, she used to give me and my brother cute small stuffed animals with hearts on them. When I moved to Ann Arbor for college, she took a different approach. Every year, she would send me a heart shaped pizza with my favorite toppings, MUSHROOMS!</p>\n<p>This past Valentine's Day, however, I was in India so neither was possible. So my cousins and I decided to celebrate Galentine's Day instead! We made some delicious red velvet cupcakes from scratch, enjoyed some leftover batter, and watched some light hearted chick flicks. All in all, a great way to celebrate our fellow ladies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8625/16587351126_1c46565bdc_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We were pretty lazy about experimenting with the recipe so I will just leave you with <a href=\"http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2014/10/29/red-velvet-cupcakes/\">the recipe we used</a> for the cupcakes and made a basic chocolate icing following the instructions on the bag of confectioners sugar.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8631/16587382106_5c03caf20b_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8562/16426167478_8bc9ab2160_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8652/16612747142_14252b62a0_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&quot;February 14th, Valentine's Day, is about romance.

First off, there's no turkey. Secondly, <a href=\"http://uppukhara.com\">my mom</a> makes a glorious display of Thanksgiving inspired Indian dishes! From masala dosa with cranberry chutney to stuffing upma (or bread upit) and spicy herb yams, we always enjoy a large variety of dishes. The only thing I personally demand every year is pumpkin pie! I love pumpkin pie. The wonderful blend of spices and sweet, and yet it's not that sweet; perfect for someone without a strong sweet tooth!</p>\n<p>What do you get when you combine two of my favorite desserts in the world, pumpkin pie and tiramisu? Basically, it's one of the greatest desserts ever created by man. I was a little skeptical about how well this combination of flavors would be received by all of our thanksgiving guests, but it was a hit. Even without adding the usual brandy, rum, or amaretto, everyone loved the wonderful blend of flavors.</p>\n<p>One warning I have about this recipe is that you should be careful in blending the cornstarch mixture into the pumpkin creme. If this step is not done properly, you will have cornstarch lumps in your tiramisu and that is just gross.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7450/16296261980_1c317311c8_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7575/15837079972_56f32edc3e_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7532/15650090328_71473d0b07_b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Pumpkin Tiramisu</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Recipe modified from  http://www.nytimes.com/projects/well/vegetarian-recipes/#recipe/pumpkin-tiramisu</em></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n        <h4>Pumpkin Creme</h4>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">⅓ cup cornstarch</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¼ cup water</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ cup milk</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 (15-ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ cup maple syrup</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ teaspoon allspice</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ teaspoon cinnamon</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">¾ teaspoon nutmeg</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">½ teaspoon salt</li>\n        <h4>Tiramisu</h4>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 pot black coffee</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">1 package lady finger biscuits</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">16oz mascarpone cheese</li>\n        <li class=\"ingredient\">ground chocolate for garnishing</li>\n      </div>\n    <!-- </div> -->\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p><strong>To make the Pumpkin Creme:</strong> In a small bowl, thoroughly mix cornstarch and water with a whisk or fork until there are <strong>NO  LUMPS</strong> and set aside.

Refrigerate for a few hours or overnight.</p><p><strong>To assemble:</strong> Soak each lady finger biscuit in coffee for a few seconds and quickly place in a large dish. Spread a layer of Pumpkin Creme on top. Repeat this process for as many layers fill up the dish or all the components run out.
