I've thrown all sorts of information in there and given it a good shake, and things are tumbling about pretty wildly right now.</p>\n<p>Exam season is upon me, and I am not bearing up well under the stress. Just don't ask me how many hot Cheetos I've consumed, because that could get super embarrassing super fast. My food consumption these days in 50% leftovers, 30% eggs, 10% random free food, and 10% cheese, so you could say things are a bit mad right now.</p>\n<p>I'm so excited to finish the semester and start cooking again. In the meantime though, I want to leave this recipe I made a bit ago here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/tj5saknljx5vewphutanvgu2he6w75gg.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I'd never made tofu scramble before, so there was quite a bit of googling involved. In the end, I came up with a recipe that hit all the right spots, and was healthy to boot! I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys savory breakfast, even the pledged carnivores; this tofu is delicious!</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Tofu Scramble</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>There are two keys to making this a good recipe: (1) extremely firm tofu - the firmest you can locate at the store, and (2) marinate it over night.</em></p>\n      <p>Yield: 2 servings</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"time\">\n      <p><strong>Total Time:</strong> <span class=\"duration\">30 minutes</span></p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"recipe-body\">\n    <div class=\"left\">\n      <h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients:</h3>\n      <div class=\"ingredients\"><h4>Marinade</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 Tbsp Soy Sauce</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">2 Tbsp C Vinegar</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">4 Tbsp Nutritional Year</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">1 Tsp Garlic Powder</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">1 Tsp Onion Powder</li>\n        <h4>Scramble</h4>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">1 Package Extremely Firm Tofu</li>\n          <li class=\"ingredient\">Handful of Broccoli</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">Handful of Kale</li>\n<li class=\"ingredient\">5-6 Mushrooms</li>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"right\">\n      <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n      <div class=\"instructions\">\n        <p>\n1.) Mix your marinade ingredients together, and add water if you need to so that it's not too thick. It should be roughly the consistency of gravy. \n</p><p> \n2.) Rip your tofu into bit sized chunks with forks or with your hands, and  mix the marinade into the tofu. Set the mixture in the fridge overnight. \n</p><p> \n3.) Chop your broccoli, kale, and mushrooms, and cook your veg - broccoli, then kale and mushrooms together. Be sure to add some salt and spices to the vegetables!\n</p><p> \n4.) When the vegetables are half cooked, create a space, and pour your tofu scramble in. Let it cook for a few minutes, 5-7 should be just enough. \n</p><p> \n5.) Pour into a bowl with some hashbrowns and enjoy! \n<pre><code>    &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n  </p></div>\n</div></div></div>","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/tj5saknljx5vewphutanvgu2he6w75gg.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c318","name":"tofu","slug":"tofu"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23f","name":"breakfast","slug":"breakfast"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c23d","name":"brunch","slug":"brunch"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c313","name":"savory","slug":"savory"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c319","name":"scramble","slug":"scramble"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31a","name":"noms","slug":"noms"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"noms","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
