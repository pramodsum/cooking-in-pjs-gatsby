They weren't tarts, they weren't REALLY puff pastry either, and\nI couldn't figure out what to call them. And then, as I was talking to a friend\nabout it, we got into a conversation about euphemisms, and the ones we both\nfavor. Hot box got thrown around a bit, but then we hit on the perfect name.\nVisually accurate (the pastries are triangles) and a little silly.\n\n\n\nLove Triangles.\n\nAnd look, I know it says vegan up there at the top, and I can hear what you're\nthinking: you don't usually like vegan pastry! It's dry, or it's weird, and are\nthere lentils in there because you heard that vegans put lentils in everything!\n\n\n\nBut these pastries don't taste vegan. I think there's this idea that vegan food\nhas to be healthy, and taste healthy, and while I would definitely advocate for\nhealthy food generally, that's not the case here. This recipe is full of lovely\nfats in the form of coconut oil, and yummy yummy carbs. It's delicious. You\nwon't believe it's not butter in there. The pastry is flaky and crisp at the\nsame time, the apples are tender and perfectly cooked, and the pecans add a hint\nof interest inside.\n\n\n\nIt's a teeny weeny pie to warm the bits of your soul that have been snowed into.\nIn the middle of winter, when you come in from the cold, these are the perfect\nbits to warm your hands and your stomach as you cuddle into your couch with a\nwarm cup of tea.\n\nLove Triangles\nThese take a bit of time, but the end result is well worth it. Just note that\nthe chilling instructions aren't really optional; the whole point is to keep the\ncoconut oil intact throughout the preparation, so that when it gets into the\noven, it melts into the pastry creating flakiness and richness. Without chilling\nitems appropriately, the dough becomes too difficult to work with, and it\ndoesn't cook properly in the oven. So. Chill out. Chill your dough, chill your\nbaking trays, chill your filling. Your stomach will thank you later.\n\nYield: 16 mini pastries\n\nTotal Time:  1 hour active, four hours passive\n\nIngredients:\nPastry Dough\n2 C Unbleached All Purpose Flour1 teaspoon salt3/4 C Coconut Oil, cold but\npliableIce Water, 1/4 cup - 1 cup, as needed\n Filling\n4 Medium Apples, preferably a variety, cored and grated\n 1/2 Tsp. Cinnamon1/2 Tsp. All-Spice1/2 Tsp. Nutmeg1/2 Tsp. Cardamom1/2 Tsp.\nBlack Pepper1/2 Tsp. Ginger1/2 Tsp. Orange Extract1 Tsp. Vanilla Extract2 Tsp.\nLime Juice1 C Chopped Pecans\n Directions:\n\n1.) Put flour and salt in a mixing bowl, and mix together thoroughly. Add the\ncoconut oil and crumble it in with your fingers, until you have a mixture that\nlooks a little sandy - the coconut oil should not disappear completely, but\nshould be in small pea-sized or smaller chunks. Add ice water a tablespoon at a\ntime until you have a dough that's smooth, not too dry, and fairly elastic.\n\n  \n2.) Roll out the dough into a rectangle, about 6x11. Fold the two short ends in,\nso that you have a rectangle one third the size of the original. Then roll it\nout again to roughly the same size, and fold again from the short ends. Repeat\nthis process seven or eight times - this is what creates the layers in your\npastry, and I found that while this method takes time, it was not too strenuous\nand yielded good results.\n\n  \n3.) Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate. Let chill for a minimum of\nfour hours. This dough can be chilled for several days, so it works really well\nif you're trying to make it in advance.\n\n  \n4.) Now it's time for the filling! Put your cored and grated apples into a\nsaucepan, and turn on the heat. Add sugar and spices, and mix thoroughly. Allow\nthe apples to become soft and fragrant; any juice produced should evaporate, so\nthat you have mixture without extra moisture.\n\n\n5.) Once apples are cooked through, add extracts and cook for one minute. Take\noff the heat and add lime juice and pecans. Stir completely before setting in\nfridge to chill. The filling needs to be cold before you make your pastries, so\nthat it doesn't melt the coconut oil prematurely.\n\n\n6.) Grease two cookie trays with coconut oil and chill in the fridge or\nfreezer.\n\n  \n7.) Let three - four hours pass. Read a book. Take a long walk, or a short hike.\nWatch some television, or make animals out of passing clouds.\n\n  \n8.) Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Take your chilled dough out of the fridge\nand cut into 16 pieces with a sharp knife. Take one piece and roll it into a\nball, and set on a floured surface. Roll it out into a circle about 4 - 5 inches\nin diameter.\n\n\n9.) Place about a tablespoon of filling in the middle of the circle, and dot the\ncircumference with water, to make sure it sticks. Fold the dough on three sides,\nso that the base forms a triangle. Press the dough together as shown in the\npictures below, so that the seams meet in the center. Set it onto your chilled\nbaking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. You might have some\nfilling leftover, depending on the size of your apples. \n![alt](https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/a5avl89yja4umc0kd06f96jnrymm9c1s.jpg)\n\n\n10.) Bake for thirty five - forty five minutes. The tops should be golden brown\nand crispy, and some of the apple juices will escape onto the tray. That's okay.\n\n  \n11.) When they're done, take them out, and wait for them to cool. Or, if you're\nlike me, pick one up, bite in, mouth breathe until it cools, and then lament the\nfact that your burned the roof of your mouth. It's fine. These taste great with\na bit of vanilla ice cream (vegan or otherwise), a warm cup of tea, or just on\ntheir own as well.","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/praw2vkc61bu1p72w4hn5xgo6d1t6au8.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b4","name":"warmapplepie","slug":"warmapplepie-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b5","name":"allamerican","slug":"allamerican-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b6","name":"vegan","slug":"vegan-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2b7","name":"veganpastry","slug":"veganpastry-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bc","name":"pastry","slug":"pastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2bd","name":"puffpastry","slug":"puffpastry"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2be","name":"sugarrush","slug":"sugarrush-2"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c255","name":"desserts","slug":"desserts"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"warmapplepie-2","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
