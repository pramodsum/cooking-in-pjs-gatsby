For example, I (Anu) spent half the year in India, but you guys never read about my adventures with street food, or my quest to find the best masala dosas in Bangalore. While Sumu kept you all a bit more updated on her goings on, the fact is, we both want to do better.</p>\n<p>So with that in mind, we're challenging ourselves to post once a week each in 2016! You'll be getting a new post from Sumu on Wednesdays, and Anu on Sundays. We'll be sharing bits of our lives and kitchens all year, and in the interest of accountability, we've decided to implement some penalties for failure to deliver.</p>\n<p>Offense 1: Donate ten dollars to a slush fund that we will donate to a charity at the end of the year! Every other penalty on the list is also accompanied by this, so there's potential for us to donate 80 at the end of the year.</p>\n<p>Offense 2: The innocent party gets to pick 1 song for you to listen to during your entire commute.</p>\n<p>Offense 3: The innocent party gets to take a picture or pictures with puppies and send it to the offender, to show them what they're missing.</p>\n<p>Offense 4: The Chopped Challenge; the innocent party assigned the offending party a random list of ingredients, from which they must produce and consume a meal. The production of said meal must be videotaped for the innocent party's viewing pleasure.</p>\n<p>Any offenses over and above this will result in the offending party having to complete a dare that is entirely up to the whim of the innocent party. So that's pretty terrifying. All posts will also include the tag #challenge2016 so you can also check up on us.</p>\n<p><strong>May the force be with you</strong></p>\n<p>We hope you're as excited as we are :)<br>\nSumu and Anu</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VZbmOFixe3qVzvC-U7QLvsJcUQeV79GACQl0DPf4gIEKj5oFw27pplxZG6e1UwB7s_FujTfxfHLTyyyLxZlceDET3cC5gD0aItG1FYd_Dl3d1Vo5KWKx5cOJMcvvEjvbNx3-CHg90QmtpBpwjaJvZ7qX6L16KXL1j-nl1JUOuP_HbuqTTLdH0v2FoABqTx6Cmlp5DIvvzZ5YJwxsdmBX9a3uA2mhKdPDd_7covcnCiXsSMakXWaDPFBl5_J2B8joh-lgKgRfACEZrQSLTpPeULuOT5cJuEmxqw-MPQNb50K3P7M5vHgqL1o34_uVf9m5FLevjSWsaz-Ykx_FXq20bTABd10Q7X4P0Bal0NIYMYQ3vaK3Xdi1qcrGtrLhd6C4Yag0d-aq2iqEIj6T39RtlKWMG9jfJWGDpnqGmTn4QDPf3oP-2It0WMFM8TcGvlKOPF41SIHmTpSGmt0Lvc4vpqYHYJ8IuH5KDyJmi87gycu2hiMeqG9Lb1eX971UPP4hXwDfcAyWK2s1mWmmCPsglA4SHXtUntmi7xsfPsIfbxt4VEpf-FrzqtjqlWQaSzrC1Ceu_g=w353-h546-no\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>NOTE: I (Sumu) have done a complete redesign of the blog so please email me @ <a href=\"mailto:sumu@cookinginpjs.com\">sumu@cookinginpjs.com</a> if you've got any thoughts/bugs/general comments about it so I can address them ASAP!

Being the ever so responsible adult that I am, I decided that I could muster enough patience to cook lunches and dinners for my brother a few times, or at least while I was working from home. We braved it out to a farmers market and brought back a collection of various vegetables without any idea of what to make. While brainstorming ideas my brother decided that since he was spending a week in California, he was going to try and eat Mexican food for each and every meal.</p>\n<p>My next step was to figure out what kind of Mexican dish to make when all I had bought was stir fry vegetables.

It's so flavorful and deliciously rewarding every time! Every single part of a burrito/taco/bowl is overflowing with unique tastes that seem extremely complicated and intricate. I'll let you in on a little secret...I use the same seasoning to cook every single part of any Mexican dish I make. Whether it be the refried beans or fajita vegetables, it's all various spice levels of the same recipe. I'm sure that's not how authentic Mexican food is made, but hey...mine tastes pretty damn good too.</p>\n<div class=\"recipe\">\n  <div class=\"recipe-header\">\n    <h2 class=\"fn\">Sumedha's Super Secret Fajita Seasoning</h2>\n    <div class=\"summary\">\n      <p><em>Feel free to mess around with the proportions of each ingredient!
