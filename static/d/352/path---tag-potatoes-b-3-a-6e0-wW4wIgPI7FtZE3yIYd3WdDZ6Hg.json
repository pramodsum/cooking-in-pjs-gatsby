I have eaten far more than my fair share of potato, roasted, baked, chipped, fried, stir fried, mashed - you name it, I have probably tried it. I love potatoes, and today I decided I wanted to eat potatoes for lunch, and this is what I came up with.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/q8236iiwm4cvje662o3sjssi4o0lk1lg.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>These are not especially nutritious, but they're not necessarily bad for you either. I would, however, recommend adding a vegetable or something somewhere on the plate. Or you could just eat potatoes for lunch.

Shred your basil, and keep it ready. When your potatoes are done, chop them roughly into bite-sized pieces. Throw the hot potatoes into the bowl with the butter mixture, and stir until the potatoes are coated in the butter.
