We had a grand plan to\nmake eight different kinds of tacos, with a wild assortment of toppings, for all\nthe people we knew. We invited friends, looked up taco recipes with abandon, and\nprepared our stomachs by eating as much avocado as possible. Then gradually, all\nour friends realized they had lives, and we had contemplated the plan for so\nlong that it no longer seemed appealing. In the manner of gifts that you were\nsupposed to “grow into,” something that seemed so exciting when we first\nconsidered it lost all appeal with lengthy consideration. \n\n  Suddenly, taco day was a chore, something we needed to do – and if you ask\neither of our mothers, they will tell you that we rarely do those things. \n\n  So we shoved the plan to the back of the closet, along with “The Scarlet\nLetter” (which I received when I was only nine) and other childhood detritus. We\nadopted a new plan: lettuce wraps. Lettuce wraps, we reasoned, are healthier\nthan traditional tacos – there are fewer carbs, or grains, or something that we\nknow we’re supposed to avoid eating in excess. \n\n\n\n  We made Asian style lettuce wraps with egg fried noodles, vegetables cooked in\nsoy sauce, and thai-inspired peanut sauce. \n\n  To make the noodles, just make regular noodles according to the package\ninstructions. Drain them, rinse them slightly in cold water, then cooking them\nin sesame oil on the stove until they’re hot all the way through. Crack eggs\nright on to noodles and stir until fully cooked, and voila! \n\n  For the vegetables, just toss them in soy sauce, a little rice vinegar, and\nsalt and pepper, and then stir fry them until they’re ready. \n\n  And for the peanut sauce, mix a half cup of creamy peanut butter with a\ntablespoon of rice vinegar, and about a half cup of soy sauce in a bowl. Then,\nin a pan, put about two tablespoons of sesame oil. Cook about a half cup of\ndiced onions until fragrant and translucent, and add chili flakes to your taste.\nOnce your chili flakes are fully incorporated, add your mixture of peanut\nbutter, soy sauce, and vinegar and cook until heated through. \n\n  We made Mexican style lettuce wraps with homemade salsa, sweet potatoes diced\nand pan roasted with taco seasonings, and mushrooms. \n\n  For this recipe, you can pretty much make any sort of salsa you like – feel\nfree to experiment! For the sweet potatoes, just dice and cook in a pan until\nslightly crispy, and add taco seasoning like there’s no tomorrow. Trust us; you\ncannot have enough taco seasoning. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Once we were done cooking, we set all our toppings out alongside the washed\nand dried lettuce leaves, and sat right down on the floor and stuffed our faces.\n \n\n  It. Was. Awesome.","feature_image":"https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8545/15649695779_61aac68719_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c237","name":"lettuce wraps","slug":"lettuce-wraps"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c347","uuid":"156f6a9c-9dc3-4bcf-9a10-98c40146b162","title":"Squash Galore","slug":"squash-galore","published_at":"10 November, 2014","plaintext":"So recently my mom bought various different types of squash. We had spagetti\nsquash, acorn squash and some other types I honestly have no idea what they are\ncalled.\n\nOriginally they had all just been sliced in half and used as decorative bowl for\na lunch party my mom threw. But unfortunately, that resulted in tons and tons of\nleftover squash. I decided to attempt to make use of them.\n\nFirst, I made an \"alfredo\" penne pasta. Here's the recipe for reference. I did\nmake a few adjustments partially on accident; I apparently used a different kind\nof similar tasting squash instead of acorn squash (pictured below), I used\nnormal milk instead of plant milk and a little mozzerella cheese instead of\nyeast flakes.\n\n\n\nAcorn Alfredo Pasta\n[http://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2010/10/acorn-squash-vegan-alfredo-sauce-kamut.html]\nRecipe by\nhttp://kblog.lunchboxbunch.com/2010/10/acorn-squash-vegan-alfredo-sauce-kamut.html\n\nIngredients:\nAcorn Alfredo Sauce\n4 Cups roasted Acorn Squash (about 1 medium squash)\n 1 cup fresh basil\n 3/4 cup milk\n 1/3 cup mozzarella cheese\n 2-3 Tbsp EVOO\n 2-3 Tbsp Dijon Mustard\n 2-3 Tbsp apple cider vinegar\n 2 Tbsp roasted garlic\n 2 Tbsp dried Italian herbs (basil, oregano, thyme)\n 1 Tbsp maple syrup\n 1 tsp red pepper flakes or dash of cayenne\n salt and pepper\n \n1 bag pasta\n 2-3 cups mushrooms\n Directions:\nTurn on oven to 350 degrees.\n\nFill a casserole dish with an inch of water. Slice Acorn Squash in half\n(horizontal slice as shown) and lay flat in dish. Place in oven to roast at 350\ndegrees for 60-75 minutes.\n\nWhen your squash is roasted the skin should peel away quite easily. Remove all\nskin and place squash flesh in a food processor. Add all other ingredients.\n\nBlend on high for at least 2 minutes. You want all the parsley to chop into fine\nbits. Set sauce aside.\n\nBoil a pot of salted water. Cook your pasta. 2-3 minutes before the pasta is\nready to drain, add mushrooms and optional protein add-in's. Drain as usual.\nToss dry pasta in a splash of EVOO (opt'l).\n\nToss warm pasta in your Acorn Alfredo Sauce. Mix well so each pasta bit is\ncoated.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt honestly looked quite delicious! It wasn't bad, but personally I'd rather\njust eat a smaller portion of normal alfredo rather than fabricating the same\nkind of taste with squash.\n\nWhen my mom came home and informed me I had used the wrong squash to make my\npasta, we decided to actually make use of the REAL acorn squash! We kept it\nsimple, just seasoning slice and roasting them as \"fries\". This in comparison\nwas amazing. It was very similar to sweet potato fries. We loved it so much we\nactually ate most of them before even thinking of taking a photo! :)\n\nThe final remaining squash we had left was spaghetti squash. Initially, we were\nconfused on what it had to do with spaghetti at all, but once we stuck it in the\noven for a while with a little oil, it finally made sense. After roasting the\nsquash, it looks just like spaghetti! Doesn't quite taste the same, but could\nwork as a substitute.\n\nThis time we decided to make pizza using the squash to make the crust. The most\nimportant thing to keep in mind when using spaghetti squash to make pizza crust\nis to really squeeze ALL of the moisture out of it before putting it in the\noven. The less moisture when cooking, the crispier and less flimsy the pizza\ncrust! We used this recipe\n[http://sharedappetite.com/recipes/gluten-free-spaghetti-squash-pizza-crust/] \nby Shared Appetite [http://sharedappetite.com]. We covered 1/2 of the pizza with\npesto sauce (hence the insane amount of oil in the picture) and 1/2 with\nmarinara sauce, tossed a few mushroom slices, covered it with cheese and then\nbaked the \"pizza\".\n\n\n\nIn all honesty, I realize I'm not a HUGE squash fan. My parents didn't hate the\npasta or the pizza. It just didn't feel the same. I'd personally rather indulge\nin smaller portions in the real thing rather than trying to replicate the same\nexperience with other ingredients. However, I would definitely recommend that\nyou try acorn squash fries! Those were amazing :)","feature_image":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5613/15216086813_bef71f0970_b.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22e","name":"squash","slug":"squash"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22f","name":"pasta","slug":"pasta"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c230","name":"pizza","slug":"pizza"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c231","name":"acorn","slug":"acorn"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c232","name":"spaghetti","slug":"spaghetti"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c233","name":"fries","slug":"fries"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c33f","uuid":"a5188542-9fe4-4445-8e55-9ffc5a39a59e","title":"The Perfect Fall Soup","slug":"the-perfect-fall-soup","published_at":"27 October, 2014","plaintext":"As leaves turn crunchy on sidewalks and the wind blows colder, I (Anu) get a\ncraving for soup. It’s part of fall. I don’t go for pumpkin everything, but as\nsoon as fall starts, I pull out boots, sweaters, and the ingredients for soup.\nThe thing is, Sumu won’t drink soup unless it’s pho, whereas I will drink any\nsoup you put before me, so this was a bit of a solo adventure.\n\nI made this soup while bugging Sumu with text after text regarding my soup\nadventure. She continued to inform me that she didn’t like soup (which I’ve\nactually known for quite a while now) and I continued bothering her with\ndescriptions of roasting vegetables and the warm veggie-y soup-y smells coming\nfrom my oven.\n\nI’m not going to lie to you; this is a simple soup, but it takes a few hours to\nprepare. There’s the cutting and arranging, the sprinkling and drizzling, the\nlovely roasting, the blending, and the simmering. But this is mostly passive\ncooking, and in the end, you get this gorgeous orangey-red soup which is made\nentirely with whole heart-healthy foods. It’s old fashioned, it’s got a bit of a\nbite from the pepper and the chilies, and it tastes great with toast and olive\noil, with a dash of cilantro for garnish.\n\nThis is the perfect fall soup; it mimics the lovely turning of the leaves\noutside, and puts you in the mind for roaring fires, thick nubby socks, and\ncrusty brown bread.\n\n * \n *   Three red bell peppers\n *   Chili peppers (to taste) \n *   Two carrots\n *   Two medium-sized onions\n *   Half a sweet potato\n *   Ten Roma tomatoes (approx. three lbs) \n *   Black Pepper (to taste) \n *   Two tbsp. olive oil\n *   Salt (to taste) \n *   Chili powder (to taste) \n *   One tbsp dry basil \n *   One half cup cashews \n\nSo to be totally honest, I made this recipe up as I went along. I knew I wanted\na spicy soup with tons of roasted tomatoes, and I just decided to add other\nvegetables as I went along. So, if you don’t like any of the stuff mentioned\nabove, just swap it out for something you do like. I’m sure many varieties of\nsquash would taste amazing in this soup, and if you’re a pumpkin everything\nsorta fall person, just roast that along with everything else! I am also a gal\nwho LOVES her chilies. I love spicy food. I cannot overstress this point, and\nthat was the biggest reason I added cracked pepper, chili powder, and raw\nchilies with a liberal hand. If you are less in love with fiery food, by all\nmeans use only one or two of these things (if you take one thing out, take out\nthe chili powder) and simple adjust to your family’s taste. Keep in mind that\nwe’ll be adding water at the final stage, so the spice and veggies will be\ndiluted just a bit.\n\nNow, to the actual recipe!\n\nBefore you do anything, soak those cashews in water – just set them in a bowl so\nthey’re just covered and cover the bowl with a plate or something. Let sit\nundisturbed until ready for use. Next, set your oven to preheat to 350 degrees.\n\nNow, get your veggies out and cut and arrange them onto baking trays. I left my\nbell peppers whole and stuffed my chilies inside to ensure that the chilies\nwouldn’t burn. I cut my onions into quarters, my carrots in half, my sweet\npotato into thick medallions, and all my tomatoes in half. Depending on the size\nof your veggies you may choose to go bigger or smaller – it’s really up to you –\njust make sure that many of your veggies are close in size to one another, so\nthat they cook at approximately similar rates. Over the top of your veggies,\nsprinkle olive oil, salt, basil, cracked pepper, and chili powder. If you like\nother spices and wanted to add those as well/instead, go ahead! This is YOUR\nSOUP – feel the cooking genius in you come alive as you play with flavor\ncombinations.\n\nSlide your baking trays into the oven, and settle in for the hardest part; the\nwaiting. Your veggies will roast for over an hour – mine took right around an\nhour and fifteen minutes. You want to roast until your bell peppers are all but\ncollapsed, your onions and tomatoes are shriveling (the tomato more so than the\nonion), and your sweet potatoes and carrots are soft to the touch. For many of\nyou, it is likely possible to get other work done while you wait. I’d wager that\nyou have the will power required to be productive while your oven emanates\nsmells and your kitchen comes alive.\n\nI myself turned on the oven light and parked myself right in front of it with a\ngood book, looking up frequently to check on the veggies. To each their own.\n\nAfter your vegetables are done roasting, turn off your oven and let your baking\ntrays remain inside until just cooled – about half an hour. You want the\nvegetables to be at a point where they’re still warm, but not so much so that\nyou can’t handle them with your bare hands. Now, if you have an immersion\nblender, you can put all your veggies and the cashews you’ve been soaking into\nwhatever pot you’ve set aside for soup and get to blending. I myself blended the\nveggies and cashews in batches in my blender (it took me three batches) before\npouring all of it into a soup pot with about two cups of water to start.\n\n  \n\nI stirred and added water until I was pleased with the consistency, then covered\nit and let it simmer. I stirred about every ten minutes to fully combine the\nwater and the veggies, and made last minute adjustments to taste at this stage.\nFinally, after about a half hour of chopping, an hour and fifteen of roasting, a\nhalf hour of cooling, and another half hour of blending and simmering, it was\nready. I opted for traditional grilled cheese, and garnished with a drizzle of\nolive oil and some cilantro, and welcomed fall in the best and yummiest way\npossible.","feature_image":null,"tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22b","name":"soup","slug":"soup"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22c","name":"fall","slug":"fall"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22d","name":"tomato","slug":"tomato"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c343","uuid":"c162695b-24a0-403b-9e68-876c1f48541d","title":"Sushi Go-Round","slug":"sushi-go-round","published_at":"14 October, 2014","plaintext":"  \n\n  When we were little, we didn’t totally get along a hundred percent of the\ntime. And when we did, we were usually playing on my original Nintendo 64. I\nonly had two games that really interested us – a Winnie the Pooh game and\nPokémon Stadium, and we were obsessed with the mini-games on Pokémon Stadium; we\nused to play them over and over, trying our best to beat the other out. One of\nthe games featured a bunch of Lickatungs swiping sushi off of a rotating table\nwith their gigantic and hilariously gross tongues. At the time, neither of us\nhad eaten sushi, and we used to talk about what it would taste like, and whether\nor not we ourselves could make it. Now, roughly ten years after last playing\nthat game (we held on long after most others had let go) we finally made sushi!\nAnd while we didn’t go around swiping it up with our tongues, we were definitely\ntempted. \n\n  \n\n  The entire process was far easier than we expected, and since we made it at\nhome, we got to mess around a little with our fillings! We just julienned some\nof the vegetables we liked and we were ready to mix and match to our heart’s\ncontent. \n\nVegetables:\nCucumber Carrot Avocado  Asparagus Sweet Potato Mushrooms  Nori (roasted seaweed\n– if you have a preferred brand/type, go with it!)   Obviously, if you don’t\nlike any of these vegetables but do like others, feel free to use those instead!\nWe were planning to use red peppers, and then realized we didn’t have any, so we\njust did without them – it’s really no big deal, especially if you’re just\ncooking for yourself. \n\nCondiments/Toppings:\nSpicy Mayo (we made our own with Sriracha and Mayonnaise) Wasabi Sauce Soy Sauce\n Rice:\nRice Wine Vinegar Sugar Long grain white rice (we used basmati, and it was\nfine!)    The amount of rice you want to make is directly proportional to the\namount of sushi you want to produce; we used about three cups of rice (when\nuncooked) to make about twelve rolls of sushi. If you’re cooking for two to four\npeople, two cups of rice will be more than enough. \n\n  We got a head start with rice we had left over from the day before – rather\nthan making rice again, we just added rice wine vinegar and sugar to it before\nheating it up, and then chilling it. If you have to make rice, though, you can\ndo so either in a pan on the stove or in a rice cooker. In a rice cooker, put in\na 1:2 ratio of rice to water, and let sit for three “screams” of the cooker. If\nyou’re making it in a saucepan, just use similar ratios, stir at the beginning,\nand then leave it alone for about twenty minutes. Once it’s fully cooked, take\nit off the stove and mix in the sugar and vinegar fully – let it chill for a\nlittle while (we stuck it in the freezer to speed that up a bit). \n\n  While your rice is chilling, cut your vegetables into long, thin strips – the\nthinner your strips, the easier it will be to fit multiple fillings in one sushi\nroll, and the easier time you’ll have rolling it at the end. \n\n  Now it’s time to mix your spicy mayo. The making of spicy mayo is largely to\ntaste – we used about one tablespoon of mayo to one teaspoon of sriracha, but\nyou can adjust with more or less sriracha depending on how spicy you like your\nfood. \n\n  Finally, after all this prep, it’s time to get rolling! Set out a towel, set\nyour bamboo mat on top of it, and put a sheet of cling wrap on top of that. If\nyou don’t have a bamboo mat, just set your cling wrap on top of your towel.\nWhile it might be a bit more difficult for you to get the perfect roll, it can\ncertainly done. \n\n  Now, set your nori sheet on top of the cling wrap, spread a thin layer of rice\nover it, and your vegetables at one end on top of your rice. Starting at the end\nwith the vegetables, start rolling the nori carefully so that your veggies are\nat the middle of your roll, making sure the roll is as tight as possible without\nripping the seaweed. You want to have a compact roll with veggies nestled at the\nvery center. \n\n  Rolling is a trial and error activity; my first rolls were far from pretty (in\nfact, we had to eat the piles of rice and seaweed with spoons!) but by the\nfourth or fifth roll, I pretty much had the hang of it. \n\n  Once you’re done rolling your sushi, cut it up into slices about ¾ of an inch\nthick, and set them on a plate. Set all your condiments out, and get ready to\nenjoy your delicious hand-made sushi. \n\n  Bring on the noms!","feature_image":"https://scontent-b-ord.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/n31.0-8/1941326_10152901018779384_657077737554217091_o.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c22a","name":"sushi","slug":"sushi"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c344","uuid":"387e6233-162d-4a84-b5f3-7808f02e256c","title":"first post. much excitement. wow","slug":"first-post-much-excitement-wow","published_at":"08 October, 2014","plaintext":"","feature_image":"http://i.imgur.com/Fg91yh0.jpg","tags":[]}}]}},"pageContext":{"limit":6,"skip":54,"numPages":10,"currentPage":10}}
