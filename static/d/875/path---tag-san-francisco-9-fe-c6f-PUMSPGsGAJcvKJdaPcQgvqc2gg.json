While you are certainly welcome bring booze into\nthe mix, these are instructions for figuring out an all food crawl; it's an\nexcellent way to explore a new city!\n\nIt's also a really good way to spend a couple of hours with friends without\nspending a ton of money; if you're on a budget, this is a great way to try lots\nof different food, and see quite a bit, without breaking the bank. We each paid\nfor one entree at one place, and it came out perfectly for us!\n\nFirst, you need a walkable city. I myself did this with my friends Eden and\nHafsa in San Francisco, the day I last left Sumu.\n\n\n\nSecond, do some preliminary research. Don't actually choose all the places you\nwant to go, but choose 1 or 2, or find a neighborhood that has a ton of stuff\nyou're interested in exploring. We found ourselves wandering around the Mission\nDistrict, ogling wall art and talking about gentrification.\n\nThird, set off on your journey! Start with a place you know you want to go to;\nwe started with Philz Coffee, which also let us sip and wander for a bit before\nwe found real food.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the next several hours, we tried Thai food, Mexican food,\nVietnamese food, and, finally, Ethiopian food. At each place, we would choose\none entree to share, so that in the end, we all got to try tons of yummy food\nfor relatively little!\n\nWe were having so much fun we failed to take a lot of pictures, but this is\ndefinitely one of those days that I'll be remembering for quite a while! If you\ndo a food crawl, let me know how it goes!\n\nAnd, if you're in DC or San Francisco and you're interested in doing this, hit\nSumu or I up! We'd love to have you :)","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/ifb3j8uif6p154mugitpvrh06kyjpziu.jpeg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c234","name":"herbivores","slug":"herbivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c246","name":"carnivores","slug":"carnivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c262","name":"eating out","slug":"eating-out"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c235","name":"vietnamese","slug":"vietnamese"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c243","name":"mexican","slug":"mexican"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c250","name":"thai","slug":"thai"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f5","name":"san francisco","slug":"san-francisco"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31b","name":"betterlate","slug":"betterlate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31c","name":"than never","slug":"than-never"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31d","name":"monday","slug":"monday"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31e","name":"food crawl","slug":"food-crawl"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c31f","name":"ethiopian","slug":"ethiopian"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c320","name":"mission","slug":"mission"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c378","uuid":"4f6c5f80-e95b-43b4-882b-0df100605e8e","title":"New City, New Beginnings","slug":"new-city-new-beginnings","published_at":"14 April, 2016","plaintext":"So things have been a bit crazy for me over the last few weeks. I made my first\nsolo move as an adult. I packed up my apartment in Sunnyvale and finally  moved\nto San Francisco. If you're wondering why I picked this specific Van Morrison\nsong, I felt like it was meant to be. The song Saint Dominic's Preview has a lot\nof references to the Saint Dominic's Church on the intersection of Bush and\nSteiner in San Francisco, literally a block from my new apartment. Everyday when\nI walk back from the bus stop after work, I pass by this gorgeous church and\nadmire it. It just felt right to pick this song for the post. :)\n\nHowever, if that song isn't your speed and you want something a little more\nsultry, try this one by Carmen McRae.\n\nI've had a blast since moving out here. I get to see my friends almost every\nday. I have a wonderful new roommate who I've known since college. Even after\nonly a week, I've got to attend all sorts of weird and yet awesome things! This\nwas an art exhibit that was installed right outside City Hall over this past\nweek.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd best of all, I get to cook with my friends, both old and new! I went over to\na friend's place yesterday night and me and a new friend, Kerry, began to make\nsome DELICIOUS fresh spring rolls. Granted, the recipe for this has been posted\non this site before, the food could never have been more delicious and\ndifferent. We filled these with lettuce, shrimp, vermicelli noodles, and more!\nWe even made some peanut sauce to dip the rolls in (just mix some hoisin sauce\nand creamy peanut butter together). Simple, yet delicious!\n\nWe did have some mishaps during the process. San Francisco kitchens are usually\nTINY, as are a lot of the apartments. My friend's kitchen is very much sizable\nfor 1 person cooking. When you try to squeeze 4 people in there, chaos ensues.\n\n 1. We were lied to about the presence of peanut butter, hence sending the boys\n    on one trip to the store\n 2. Kerry and I weren't aware that the pasta strainer LOCKED onto the pot we\n    were cooking the noodles in. This unfortunately caused ALL of the noodles to\n    fall into the sink, hence a second trip to the store to get more noodles\n 3. The boys may never let us live this down. Highly unlikely after all the sass\n    given while Kerry and I made their dinner.\n 4. They showed me this amazing group that performs acoustic covers of popular\n    songs [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y7Vq9749s8]... MIND BLOWING. I'm not\n    gonna lie I may have teared up a bit.\n\nWhile I may not have an explicit recipe for you, I have plenty of photos and\nfull stomachs as proof. Enjoy!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/me9os02qsilwhgg2oojd7wv5dvutsamk.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c7","name":"sumuchallenge2016","slug":"sumuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c30e","name":"spring rolls","slug":"spring-rolls"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f5","name":"san francisco","slug":"san-francisco"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c30f","name":"fresh rolls","slug":"fresh-rolls"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c246","name":"carnivores","slug":"carnivores"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c317","name":"shrimp","slug":"shrimp"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c318","name":"tofu","slug":"tofu"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c29c","name":"friends","slug":"friends"}]}},{"node":{"id":"Ghost__Post__5c47a6f72037ef002282c371","uuid":"c29b2ef2-5742-41db-8c7d-ee40d863ac36","title":"California Gurrrrllllll","slug":"california-gurrrrllllll","published_at":"29 February, 2016","plaintext":"Spring break baby! As of Friday, I am SORT OF on spring break. While I have an\nassignment due tomorrow that I am still working on, I've been in California\nvisiting Sumu since Friday!\n\nWhile I've buckled down a bit today, Sumu and I spent all of yesterday and this\nmorning running around San Francisco and nearby beaches.\n\nThe soundtrack to our trip?\n\nWe started off our day at Land's End Recreation Area, which was hands down my\nfavorite part of the trip so far. We parked, and it was about a mile walk to the\nbeach. The entire area was insanely picturesque, and I was half convinced that\nwe had stepped out of San Francisco and into a Lord of the Rings movie.\n\n\n\nFrom there, we went to get brunch, before heading to Valencia St. to look at\nstreet art, before heading to Dolores Park. On the way, we passed the The\nWomen's Building, which has one of the coolest murals I've ever seen on it - if\nyou find yourself in SF, definitely head over there. It's a celebration of\nwomen, and it's totally gorgeous.\n\n\n\nAfter that, we went to Dolores Park and visited the Golden Gate Bridge at\nsunset!\n\nToday, we woke up bright and early and headed to Capitola and Natural Bridges\nState Beach. We wandered around the beach for a while before getting ourselves\nto our favorite meal: brunch.\n\n\n\nThis place was pretty small, but really cute, and had excellent brunch options.\nI ordered Gallo Pinto, which was described on the menu as a Costa Rican dish.\n\n\n\nI liked my dish a lot; the plantains, rice, egg, and sauce went really well\ntogether, and I found myself clearing my plate!\n\nSumu got the Veggie Cocota, with was veggies and poached eggs covered in a\nCocota sauce. Research indicates that Cocota is a neighborhood in Brasil,\nalthough I can't speak to the authenticity of the sauce. Either way, it was\npretty good; the sauce is quite strong, and while I thought it was delicious, it\nwas a bit much for brunch.\n\n\n\nEither way, definitely worth a visit. If you're in Santa Cruz, definitely head\nover; they also have fresh juice that's perfect for taking with you to the\nbeach!","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/hinrb93xbood40avb37ozvuldf5qqbtg.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c26c","name":"california","slug":"california"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f1","name":"besties","slug":"besties"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f2","name":"visits","slug":"visits"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f3","name":"spring break","slug":"spring-break"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f4","name":"santa cruz","slug":"santa-cruz"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f5","name":"san francisco","slug":"san-francisco"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f6","name":"land's end","slug":"lands-end"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f8","name":"natural bridges","slug":"natural-bridges"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f7","name":"the shire","slug":"the-shire"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2f9","name":"golden gate","slug":"golden-gate"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fa","name":"the women's center","slug":"the-womens-center"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2fb","name":"cafe brasil","slug":"cafe-brasil"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"san-francisco","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
