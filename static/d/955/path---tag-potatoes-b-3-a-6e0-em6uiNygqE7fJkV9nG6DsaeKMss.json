I have eaten far more than my fair share\nof potato, roasted, baked, chipped, fried, stir fried, mashed - you name it, I\nhave probably tried it. I love potatoes, and today I decided I wanted to eat\npotatoes for lunch, and this is what I came up with.\n\n\n\nThese are not especially nutritious, but they're not necessarily bad for you\neither. I would, however, recommend adding a vegetable or something somewhere on\nthe plate. Or you could just eat potatoes for lunch. Nobody in this corner will\njudge you.\n\n\n\nThese potatoes are the easiest thing ever, and you have no reason not to make\nthem. Go make them!\n\nEasy Microwave Potatoes\nThese potatoes get a lot of flavor from the type of potato you use, so use your\nfavorite. I used\nIdaho potatoes and really enjoyed them. \n\nYield: 1 bowl; 2 side servings, 1 lunch\n\nTotal Time:  10 minutes\n\nIngredients:\n  <li class=\"ingredient\">2 Small Potatoes, or 1 Large Potato</li>\n  <li class=\"ingredient\">2 Tsp. Butter (can use vegan butter)</li>\n  <li class=\"ingredient\">1 Tsp. Miso</li>\n  <li class=\"ingredient\">1 Tsp. Tahini</li>\n  <li class=\"ingredient\">3 Large Basil Leaves</li>\n  \n</div>\n<div class=\"right\">\n  <h3 id=\"directions\">Directions:</h3>\n  <div class=\"instructions\">\n    <p>\n      1.) Stab your potato(es) and stick them in the microwave in a ceramic or glass bowl. Microwave for three minutes.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        2.) Combine your butter, miso, and tahini in a bowl, and beat it lightly with a fork. It should be creamy at the end.\n        </p>\n      <p>\n        3.) Take your potatoes out of the microwave, cut them in half, and put them back in the microwave for three or four  more minutes.\n        </p>\n      <p>\n        4.) Shred your basil, and keep it ready. When your potatoes are done, chop them roughly into bite-sized pieces. Throw the hot potatoes into the bowl with the butter mixture, and stir until the potatoes are coated in the butter. Sprinkle with basil and eat!\n      </p>\n    </div>\n</div>","feature_image":"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/hylt0nyiky2u1ox43pvzqs19mzp7w51x.jpg","tags":[{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c2c6","name":"anuchallenge2016","slug":"anuchallenge2016"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c311","name":"basil","slug":"basil"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c330","name":"potatoes","slug":"potatoes"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c331","name":"10 minute meals","slug":"10-minute-meals"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c332","name":"miso","slug":"miso"},{"id":"5c47a6f22037ef002282c333","name":"butter","slug":"butter"}]}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"potatoes","limit":6,"skip":0,"numPages":1,"currentPage":1}}
