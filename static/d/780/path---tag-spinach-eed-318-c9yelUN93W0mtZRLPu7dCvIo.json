I love the original song by Zella Day but this mix is also amazing.

All my friends would fight and complain but I would ALWAYS ask for more. I know. I was that kid. I was also that kid who would happily drink a glass of plain milk every day. Anyways... I love spinach. Whenever I used to make omelets for my mom, she used to complain that she could never find the egg because I had overloaded it with so much spinach.</p>\n<p>So when I was living alone in Sunnyvale, I decided one week I was going to be super healthy and make meals filled with tons of vegetables. Obviously, this being me, ended up just an obscene amount of spinach and mushrooms. That's about it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://pramods.box.com/shared/static/s87a60v38mfk5xbloe2r5i0ftvajj24h.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This recipe is super easy and delicious.

Usually that ends up being some simple pasta, vegetable fajitas, or toppings on a veggie burger. This time, I figured, why not try something different and make a veggie patty using these vegetables!</p>\n<p>It ended up being some kind of frittata/omelets/burger patty thing. While I may not be entirely sure what to call it, it tasted wonderful. And to my delight, it photographed really well! I actually ate the patty by itself but you could definitely eat these inside a burger or chopped up in a salad.
